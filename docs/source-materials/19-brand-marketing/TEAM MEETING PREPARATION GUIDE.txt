[MODULE:STRATEGY EXECUTION - SPRINT:BRAND AND MARKETING]
TEAM MEETING PREPARATION GUIDE 














[01/04]
Purpose of the Meeting
Objectives
This sprint session is designed to align the entire leadership team around the core of the brand and the marketing execution that flows from it. The goal is to create full consistency between strategy, brand promise, employee value proposition, and marketing communication.

This meeting will:
Translate the strategy into a differentiated brand promise 
Define the emotional and strategic core of both the consumer and employee brands 
Clarify how you want to be perceived and what we will never be
Establish a baseline for all marketing and communication going forward
This sprint is critical. Marketing and branding are not creative playgrounds — they are the most public execution of strategy. If we fail to define them clearly, consistently, and with emotional power, all external efforts will be diluted and disconnected.

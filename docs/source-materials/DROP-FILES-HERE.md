# Source Materials Checklist
## Drop the missing files into each folder. I'll handle the rest.

For each tool below, I already have the **course .md file** from the LMS folder.
I need you to download and drop the **individual tool** and **team tool** PDFs/PPTXs.

**How to export:** Open the PPTX/XLSX in your app → Save As / Export → PDF.
Put the PDF in the matching folder below.

## QUICK ACTION SUMMARY

**Already have tools in LMS (just need PDF export):**
09, 10, 11, 17, 18, 21, 25, 28

**Have TEAM tool only (need individual from LearnWorlds):**
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27

**Special cases:**
- 06: Check what's in `tool/` folder
- 11: Has 5 different tools (Big Rock, Meeting eval, Meeting readiness, Quarterly priorities, Annual review)
- 29: Survey only, no traditional tool
- 30: No tools found
- 32: Program overview, likely no tool

**For tools with XLSX only:** Export to PDF so I can read the layout. Or just drop the XLSX and I'll work from the course .md descriptions.

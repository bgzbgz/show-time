Tool explanation and guide – FOR REVIEW ONLY
[01/07]
TOOL PREVIEW

[02/07]
Purpose  
In the Fast Track arsenal, the 'Individual priorities breakdown' is the weapon against overwhelming priorities. Once priorities are set, this tool slices them into manageable, bite-sized actions. It's about turning the daunting into the doable.
Benefits of using it
Transforms overwhelming tasks into a series of achievable steps. 
Kickstarts momentum by identifying an easy, clear first step. 
Aligns with the Fast Track philosophy of action – by breaking down the big game, procrastination is sidelined.
[03/07]
Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Identify Your Priority: Pinpoint that big, intimidating elephant in the room.

2. Slice It Strategically: Divide it into up to 5 manageable steps.

3. Start Simple: Ensure the first step is the simplest, about showing up and starting.

4. Define Subsequent Steps: Gradually increase complexity in each step.

5. Set Clear Deadlines: Each step gets a deadline to maintain forward momentum.

6. Assign the hours needed to complete each tasks. The tool will show you if there are week where the allocated time is more than what you have as working hours.
[04/07]
do's and don'ts
Do's
Start with the simplest possible action. 
Celebrate completing each step to maintain morale.
Keep your eyes on the ultimate goal. 
Dont's
Let the complexity of the final goal deter you.
Rush through steps without thorough completion.
Lose focus on why each step matters.
[05/07]

mistakes to avoid
1. Wrong first steps: Choosing a first step that's too complex.
Simplify the first step until it feels almost too easy.
2. Starting with a step that doesn't directly contribute to the end goal.
Ensure the first step is essential for progress toward the overall objective.
3. Neglecting to reassess steps: Failing to update or adapt steps when new information becomes available.
Stay flexible and adjust steps as needed.
4. Overcomplicating early steps
Assign a dedicated facilitator to keep the process on track.
5. Underestimating the first step: Assuming the initial step is too easy and skipping essential groundwork.
Ensure the first step is solid and sets the right foundation.
[06/07]


f.a.q. and answers

big rock discussion 
Tool explanation and guide – FOR REVIEW ONLY
[01/05]
introduction
The Big Rock Discussion is more than a one-off solution—it is a structured, repeatable process tool embedded within the Meeting Rhythm to address critical organizational challenges effectively. Designed to maximize clarity, focus, and actionable outcomes, this process helps teams resolve significant bottlenecks, align on solutions, and drive continuous improvement.
[02/05]
TOOL PREVIEW

[03/05]
Purpose  
To analyze and solve critical issues (“Big rocks”) in 30 minutes with maximum efficiency, leveraging Elon Musk’s first principles of thinking, Theory of Constraints, 80/20, simplicity, and the Law of Subtraction.

The goal is to strip problems to their core, identify bottlenecks, and focus only on high-impact actions.
Positive outcomes
Improved decision-making: Ensures issues are analyzed thoroughly before solutions are implemented. 
Consistency: Teams know what to expect and how to contribute effectively.
Proactive problem-solving: Identifies bottlenecks early, preventing escalation. 
Increased accountability: The WWW framework ensures clear ownership and follow-up. 
[04/05]
Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Clarify the core problem (5 min)
A crystal clear, razor-sharp problem statement.
What is the issue at its most basic level? 
If we had to explain this problem to a 10-year-old, how would we phrase it? 
Why is this issue the most important thing to address now?
What measurable outcome defines success?
[AVOID]
Vagueness: Overcomplicating the problem or using broad definitions. 
Scope creep: Adding unrelated topics to the discussion.
Premature solutions: Discussing fixes before understanding the problem. 
2. Deconstruct the problem (5 min)
A prioritized breakdown of the problem’s core constraints and elements.
Action 1: First Principles Thinking
What do we know to be absolutely true about this problem? 
What are the foundational facts we can build upon?
If we ignored conventional approaches, how would we approach this from scratch? 
Are we making any assumptions that we haven’t validated?
Action 2: Theory of Constraints
What is the single biggest bottleneck preventing progress?
Which part of the process or system is slowing everything else down?
If we addressed this one constraint, how much of the problem would improve? 
Is this constraint internal (within our control) or external (outside our control)? 
Action 3: Law of Subtraction
What can we remove or stop doing that would simplify the problem? 
Are there unnecessary steps, processes, or elements adding complexity? 
What would this problem look like if we started with a clean slate? 
[AVOID]
Overcomplication: Getting lost in irrelevant details.
Assumption Bias: Failing to challenge deeply held beliefs.
Distraction: Allowing the discussion to shift from constraints to minor issues. 
3. Identify the Root cause(s) (10 min)
A concise statement of the root cause(s).
Action 1: The 5 Whys Technique
Why does this issue exist? (Repeat “Why?” for each response.) 
What directly caused this issue to occur?
What systemic or recurring factor might be driving this problem? 
If this cause were eliminated, would the problem still exist?
Action 2: 80/20 
Which 20% of factors are driving 80% of this issue’s impact? 
Are there recurring themes or patterns that explain most of the problem? 
[AVOID]
Shallow analysis: Addressing symptoms rather than the root cause. 
Groupthink: Letting dominant voices lead without challenge.
Data neglect: Ignoring evidence that contradicts initial assumptions. 
4. Generate high-impact solutions (7 min)
A shortlist of 2-3 prioritized, actionable solutions
1. Brainstorm solutions that directly address the bottleneck or root cause(s).
2. Apply impact/easy.
3. Law of Subtraction: Eliminate unnecessary steps in proposed solutions.
What steps or actions can we remove to make the solution simpler and more direct? 
Are there unnecessary features, processes, or steps in our proposed solutions?
What is the minimum viable solution that still effectively addresses the root cause?
How can we design the solution to require fewer resources or dependencies?
4. Confirm the solution can be implemented with existing resources.
Can this solution be implemented immediately with the resources we have? 
What is the cost (time, money, effort) of implementing this solution, and does the expected impact justify it?
Do we have the skills, tools, or capacity needed to execute this solution? 
Are there any quick wins or low-hanging fruit we can tackle right now? 
[AVOID]
Overloading: Proposing too many solutions, leading to indecision. 
Overengineering: Creating overly complex or resource-intensive ideas. 
Ignoring Constraints: Suggesting solutions that don’t address the bottleneck 
5. WWW
Identify the top three next steps.
Assign responsibility for each action.
Define KPIs and set a follow-up timeline.
[AVOID]
Ambiguity: Leaving the next steps undefined or vague.
Lack of Ownership: Failing to assign clear responsibilities.
No Follow-Up: Neglecting to review progress in future meetings.
rules
1. Time Discipline: Use a timer to stay strictly within time limits.

2. Facilitator Role: Assign a strong moderator to maintain focus and flow.

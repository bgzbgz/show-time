Define the Name of the product or service in the first column.
Answer the following:
 - Is it targeted at your core customer? (Yes/No)
 - What specific pain or need does it address? 
 - Are the product’s features “must-have” or “nice-to-have” for the customer? 
 - What is its strategic role? Choose one:
      Storyteller – defines your brand or innovation.
      Topline Contributor – generates volume and revenue.
      Profit Contributor – high-margin or premium?
2. Commercial data entry
Collect and enter the following for the last 6 months:
Monthly transaction volume (units sold per month)

[02/02]
Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Plot competitors
Place key competitor products on the 2D map:
   X-axis = Sales Volume
   Y-axis = Price
Use your knowledge or best estimates to position them accurately. 
Label each point with the competitor’s product name. 
2. Plot your products
Collect and enter the following for the last 6 months:
Place your own products on the same chart. 
Use different colors or symbols to indicate strategic roles
   Storyteller
   Revenue Contributor
   Profit Contributor
Use current sales volume and pricing data from the evaluation sheet. 
3. Analyze the portfolio map
As a team, discuss:
Are your products evenly spread or clustered in one area? 
Do you have enough high-margin vs. volume drivers?
Are there areas where competitors dominate and you’re absent? 
Are any products misaligned with their intended strategic role?
Adjust product roles or pricing if needed based on what you see on the map.
Final step: review and decide final prices
Once both tools—the Current Product & Pricing Evaluation and the Price Map—have been completed, take time as a team to step back and review your portfolio with fresh perspective.

Conclude with a strategic review:
Revisit the products you’ve assigned to the Storyteller, Revenue Contributor, and Profit Contributor categories.
Based on the updated performance data, customer value insights, and competitive positioning, confirm whether each product is still in the right role.
Adjust if needed—some products may shift categories depending on what the price map and analysis reveal.
Then, align on:
Final pricing decisions for each product 
Clear pricing rationale that reflects:
    Customer willingness to pay
    Strategic product role
    Competitive landscape
    Target margins and business goals
Final Note

This is your moment to translate insight into action - finalizing the pricing strategy that will guide your product portfolio moving forward.

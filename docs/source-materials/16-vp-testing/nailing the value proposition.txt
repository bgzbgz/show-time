[MODULE:STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT - SPRINT:VALUE PROPOSITION TEST]
TEAM MEETING PREPARATION GUIDE 














[01/05]
Purpose of the Meeting
Objective
This meeting is designed to finalize the value proposition based on the insights from the second round of customer interviews. The goal is to:
Lock in a clear, compelling, and differentiated value proposition. 
Ensure it addresses key customer pain points predictably.
Remove any remaining confusion, hesitation, or weak messaging. 
Align all teams on the final version for rollout.
Why this matters
A well-tested value proposition removes guesswork - we know it works. 
It becomes the core message across marketing, sales, and product development. 
Weak spots are now fixed - we don’t tweak after this, we execute.

Pre-Mortem
Potential issues that could derail the meeting
People still defending old ideas - This is about what works, not what we like.
Overcomplicating the message - Simplicity wins, complexity confuses. 
Making changes without evidence - If feedback is consistent, we trust it. 
Lack of commitment - This is final; we need full buy-in from the team.
Preventive strategies
Stick to the patterns - Only make changes backed by customer insights. 
Be ruthless in simplification - If a 10-year-old wouldn’t understand it, it’s too complex.
Decide with conviction - No endless debates. At the end of this meeting, it’s locked in. 
Align execution - Ensure everyone knows how to implement the final version.

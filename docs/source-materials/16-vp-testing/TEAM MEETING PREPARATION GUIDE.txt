[MODULE:STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT - SPRINT:VALUE PROPOSITION TEST]
TEAM MEETING PREPARATION GUIDE 














[01/05]
Purpose of the Meeting
Objective
This meeting is designed to analyze and refine the value proposition based on real customer feedback from the first round of interviews. The goal is to:
Identify what worked well - what customers responded positively to. 
Pinpoint what didn’t resonate - any confusion, hesitation, or pushback.
Uncover hidden objections - reasons customers may hesitate or reject the offer.
Adjust the value proposition based on insights to make it sharper, clearer, and more compelling. 
Why this matters
A value proposition only works if it lands the first time with customers. 
This process ensures predictability - if multiple customers react the same way, it’s a pattern. 
Weak spots must be fixed now - before launching externally or investing in marketing.

Pre-Mortem
Potential issues that could derail the meeting
Jumping to conclusions too fast - assuming one person’s reaction applies to everyone. 
Focusing on opinions, not patterns - one off-hand comment doesn’t mean a change is needed. 
Defending the original idea - the point is to improve, not justify what exists.
Overcomplicating the message - adding too much instead of refining what’s essential.
Preventive strategies
Stick to patterns - If three or more customers say it, it’s real feedback. 
Use evidence, not feelings - Base discussions on actual interview data.
Prioritize clarity over complexity - Refine the message, don’t overload it.
Be brutally honest - A weak value proposition doesn’t get better by ignoring the issues.

final Reminders
Stick to real feedback - No assumptions, only evidence. 
Avoid personal attachment - The best idea wins, not the one we started with. 
Keep it simple - If it’s not instantly clear, it’s not working.
Push for action - Refine fast, test again, don’t overthink.
The best value proposition isn’t what you think sounds good - it’s what customers can’t ignore.

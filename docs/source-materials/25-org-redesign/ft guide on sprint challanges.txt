The 10 Organizational Structure Killers
and How to Crush Them
Brutal Truth About What Goes Wrong and How to Fix It

Part 1: The 5 Sprint Meeting Killers
Killer 1: "Everything is Core" Syndrome

What Happens: 
Team argues that all activities are equally important. Marketing insists brand management is core. Finance claims budgeting is core. HR pushes talent acquisition as core. Everyone protects their territory instead of serving customers.

Why It Kills You:
When everything is core, nothing is core. You end up with 15 "core" activities that spread your focus thinner than cheap paint. Mediocrity across everything beats excellence at nothing.

How to Crush It: 
Apply the customer disappearance test. Ask: "If we stopped doing this activity tomorrow, would customers immediately cancel contracts and call competitors?" If the answer is no, it's supporting, not core. Period.

Force rank everything. Make them choose. Use CEO authority to break ties. Set a hard limit of 5 core activities maximum. No exceptions. No special cases. Five or fewer.
[GURU SCRIPT]
"I hear that this feels important to your department. But we're not organizing around what makes departments comfortable. We're organizing around what makes customers choose us over competitors."
Killer 2: People Evaluation Paralysis

What Happens: 
Team gets squeamish about honest FIT and ABC analysis. Lots of "everyone's trying their best" and "we don't want to hurt feelings." They avoid naming names. They speak in code. They protect underperformers to avoid uncomfortable conversations.

Why It Kills You:
A players in wrong seats become C players. B players without development become C players. C players without honest feedback stay C players. Your organizational structure becomes a museum for mediocrity.

How to Crush It: 
Start with leadership self-assessment. CEO goes first. Model vulnerability and honesty. Use frameworks, not personal attacks. Focus on FIT dimensions: Company, Job, Team, Boss. Frame as development opportunity, not performance punishment.

Make it data-driven. "Based on our FIT analysis, where do we see gaps?" Remove emotion. Add structure. Get specific about next steps.

[GURU SCRIPT]
"We're not here to judge people. We're here to help everyone succeed. A players in wrong seats are miserable. Helping people find their right seat is the kindest thing we can do."
Killer 3: Analysis Paralysis on Process Definition

What Happens: 
Team wants to document every step of every process before making decisions. They create flowcharts with 47 decision points. They debate whether email approval constitutes a subprocess. They turn simple process identification into doctoral dissertation planning.

Why It Kills You:
Perfect documentation without decision-making creates zero value. You leave the meeting with beautiful diagrams and no clarity on who owns what or how success gets measured.

How to Crush It: 
Keep it simple. Process identification, not process documentation. Focus on: What happens? Who owns it? How do we measure success? That's it.

Set strict time limits. Five minutes per process discussion maximum. Use timers visibly. Cut off perfectionist spirals immediately.

[GURU SCRIPT]
"We're identifying which processes matter most, not documenting every detail. Documentation comes after we decide what deserves documentation."
Killer 4: Ownership Dodging

What Happens: 
Nobody wants clear accountability for processes or outcomes. Everyone prefers collaborative ownership, shared responsibility, and committee decision-making. Phrases like "we all need to work together" and "it requires cross-functional coordination" dominate the discussion.

Why It Kills You:
Shared ownership equals no ownership. When problems arise, finger-pointing replaces problem-solving. Nobody drives improvement because nobody owns results.

How to Crush It: 
Force individual ownership assignments before moving to the next topic. One person owns each core process. They can coordinate with others, but they own the results. No committees. No shared accountability. No exceptions.

Write names on the whiteboard next to processes. Make it visible. Make it permanent.

[GURU SCRIPT]
"Process owners don't control people, they're accountable for results. If you own the process and it fails, you own the failure. If it succeeds, you own the success. Who wants that responsibility?"
Killer 5: KPI Creation Madness

What Happens: 
Team creates measurement systems that require PhD statisticians to understand. They want to track everything that moves. Seventeen KPIs per process. Metrics that need metrics to explain them. Reports that nobody will read measuring things that don't drive behavior.

Why It Kills You:
Complex measurement systems get ignored. If you can't understand it in 30 seconds, you won't check it weekly. Measurement complexity kills measurement utility.

How to Crush It: 
Apply the weekly review test. Will the CEO actually check this metric every week? If no, eliminate it. Maximum 3 KPIs per core process. Must be simple, measurable, actionable.

Ask: "Does this KPI predict success or just report what already happened?" Favor leading indicators over lagging indicators.

[GURU SCRIPT]
"If we create KPIs that nobody checks, we've created organizational theater, not organizational improvement. Simple metrics that drive behavior beat complex metrics that impress accountants."
Part 2: The 5 Implementation Execution Killers
Killer 6: The Comfort Zone Snap-Back

What Happens: 
Two weeks after the sprint, everyone reverts to old ways. The core activities list gets forgotten. Process owners stop owning processes. KPIs don't get checked. People drift back to familiar chaos because change feels uncomfortable.

Why It Kills You:
Good intentions without systematic follow-through create zero organizational change. You get the pain of disruption without the benefit of improvement.

How to Crush It: 
Schedule weekly leadership meetings with mandatory KPI reviews. Make core activities visible - post them in conference rooms, email signatures, everywhere. Assign implementation deadlines with specific accountability.

Create consequences for reverting to old ways. Reward new behavior immediately and visibly.

[IMPLEMENTATION SCRIPT]
"We're not going back to the old way because the old way was killing us. Anyone who wants to work the old way can work somewhere else."
Killer 7: Measurement System Failure

What Happens: 
KPIs get defined but never implemented. Data doesn't get collected. Reports don't get created. Process owners claim they're "too busy" to track metrics. The measurement system becomes another good idea that dies from neglect.

Why It Kills You:
You can't manage what you don't measure. Without measurement, you have no idea if organizational changes are working. Process improvement becomes guesswork instead of data-driven optimization.

How to Crush It: 
Assign one person to own measurement system implementation. Give them authority and resources. Create simple tracking methods - spreadsheets beat complex software if people actually use them.

Make KPI reviews mandatory agenda items in every leadership meeting. No measurement report, no meeting proceeds.

[IMPLEMENTATION SCRIPT]
"If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. If you're too busy to measure results, you're too busy to succeed."
Killer 8: Role Change Resistance

What Happens: 
People resist moving to new roles or taking on new responsibilities. They argue that FIT analysis was wrong. They claim they can improve in current roles if given more time. They create drama around necessary organizational changes.

Why It Kills You:
Organizational structure changes require people changes. If people block necessary role adjustments, the entire structural improvement fails. You get stuck with old problems in new frameworks.

How to Crush It: 
Move fast on role changes. Announce decisions clearly with specific timelines. Provide transition support but not indefinite accommodation. Help people succeed in new roles or help them find success elsewhere.

Frame role changes as development opportunities, not punishments. Show career advancement paths in new structure.

[IMPLEMENTATION SCRIPT]
"If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. If you're too busy to measure results, you're too busy to succeed."
Killer 9: Process Owner Accountability Gaps

What Happens: 
Process owners accept titles but avoid accountability. They claim they need more authority, more resources, more time, more cooperation from others. They become excuse generators instead of result drivers.

Why It Kills You:
Process ownership without accountability creates organizational theater. You get the complexity of new structure without the benefits of improved performance.

How to Crush It: 
Set clear expectations and deadlines for process improvement. Give process owners authority to make necessary changes. Remove obstacles to their success. Hold them accountable for results, not activities.

Create consequences for accountability avoidance. Promote successful process owners. Replace unsuccessful ones.

[IMPLEMENTATION SCRIPT]
"Process ownership means result ownership. If you want the title without the accountability, this isn't the role for you."
Killer 10: Leadership Commitment Wavering

What Happens: 
CEO and leadership team lose enthusiasm for organizational changes when implementation gets difficult. They second-guess decisions made during the sprint. They allow exceptions to new processes. They stop enforcing new accountability standards.

Why It Kills You:
Leadership inconsistency kills any organizational change effort. If leaders don't commit to the new structure, nobody else will either. The organization reverts to previous dysfunction.

How to Crush It: 
CEO must commit publicly to organizational changes with specific timelines and success metrics. Make leadership commitment visible to entire organization. Create board reporting on structural improvement progress.

Schedule monthly structure review meetings with external accountability. Document lessons learned and course corrections, but don't abandon core decisions.

[IMPLEMENTATION SCRIPT]
"We made these decisions because the old way wasn't working. Abandoning the new way at the first sign of difficulty guarantees we'll stay stuck with the old problems."

The Bottom Line on
Organizational Structure Success
These difficulties aren't hypothetical. They happen in every organizational structure initiative. The difference between companies that succeed and those that fail lies in preparation and response.

Expect these problems. Plan for these problems. Address these problems immediately when they arise.

Organizational structure isn't a one-time decision; it's an ongoing process. It's an ongoing discipline of clarity, accountability, and measurement.

Companies that master this discipline tend to dominate their markets. Companies that avoid this discipline are often dominated by competitors who adopt it.

Your choice. Your results. Your responsibility.

Stop making excuses. Start making a structure. Execute relentlessly.

TEAM MEETING PREPARATION GUIDE 














[01/04]
Purpose of the Meeting
This meeting transforms your team from a collection of individuals into a precision-engineered machine. You will define the core activities that deliver your competitive advantage, identify the processes that execute flawlessly, and evaluate whether you have the right people in the right seats.
Why This Meeting Matters:
Your organizational structure determines your speed, efficiency, and ability to execute strategy. Companies with a clear structure move 25% faster than those stuck in confusion. This 90-minute session eliminates organizational drift and creates laser focus on what drives results.
Expected Outcome:
Walk out with crystal clarity on your top 5 core activities, your 3 most critical processes, and an honest assessment of your team's alignment. No more guessing. No more scattered priorities. Pure execution focus.

Pre-Mortem: Potential Meeting Killers
Issue 1: "Everything is Core" Syndrome
Problem: Team argues that all activities are equally important 
Prevention: Apply brutal 80/20 filter. Only activities that directly deliver value proposition qualify as core 
Response: CEO makes final call when debate stalls. Move forward decisively.
Issue 2: People Evaluation Resistance
Problem: Team uncomfortable discussing individual performance and fit 
Prevention: Frame as development opportunity, not punishment. Focus on helping people succeed 
Response: Start with leadership self-assessment. Model vulnerability and honesty.
Issue 3: Analysis Paralysis on Process Definition
Problem: Over-complicating simple process mapping 
Prevention: Keep it simple. Focus on what, who, when, how measured
Response: Set 5-minute timer per process discussion. Force decisions. 
Issue 4: KPI Overwhelm
Problem: Creating too many metrics that nobody will track 
Prevention: Maximum 3 KPIs per core process. Must be measurable and actionable 
Response: Ask "Will we actually check this weekly?" If no, eliminate it.

Final Reminders
Stay Laser-Focused on Structure: This meeting is about organizational design, not strategy revision. Don't debate what to do - focus on how to organize to do it better.
Embrace Brutal Honesty: Half-truths about people and processes waste everyone's time. Say what needs to be said. Address what needs addressing.
Make Decisions, Don't Just Discuss: Every topic requires a decision before moving on. No parking lot discussions. Decide now or assign decision deadline.
Execute Immediately: Plans without action are worthless. Assign owners and deadlines for every decision made.

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Review the Segment and Promise
Begin with the profile of the segment you are targeting. 
Reread the brand and value proposition promise.
This will guide which customer goals and expectations are most important. 
2. Map the Full Journey
Open the spreadsheet.
Identify 5 to 8 key customer-facing stages, such as:
     Awareness
     First contact
     Purchase/onboarding
     Usage/support
     Renewal/exit
For each stage, fill in:
     Customer Goal: What are they trying to accomplish?
     Customer Action: What do they do?
     Customer Thought: What’s likely going through their mind? 
[TIP]
Stay in the customer’s shoes, avoid internal language like “CRM integration” or “case opened.”

Instead, use “I hope they respond quickly” or “I don’t know what to do.”
3. Identify 3 WOW Touchpoints
Select three points in the journey where you have the opportunity to exceed expectations. 
For each, complete:
     What would make this moment memorable?
     What emotional effect are we aiming for?
     What action or change is required?
     How will success be measured?
[CRITERIA]
A WOW moment must:
Reinforce your value proposition
Align with what matters most to your segment 
Be share-worthy, surprising, or deeply human 
4. Identify 3 Just Better Touchpoints
Choose three additional points where your goal is to outperform the industry standard. 
Define:
     What needs to be improved?
     How will it be executed?
     Who is responsible?
     What metric will track it?
[FOCUS ON]
Speed, clarity, tone, simplicity, consistency
5. Assign Ownership and Metrics
For every WOW and Just Better point, assign: 
A responsible team or person
A performance indicator (NPS, first response time, sentiment analysis, etc.) 
A deadline for improvement rollout

Troubleshooting and FAQs

Q: What if the team can’t agree on what’s a WOW moment?
A: Go back to the segment. Ask: “What would actually surprise or delight them?”
Q: We have too many touchpoints, which should we focus on?
A: Use the emotion filter. Choose the moments where:

          - Trust is built or broken
          - Memory is formed
          - Frustration is most common
Q: What if we’re a mix of B2B and B2C?
A: Run two journey maps. Each segment needs a separate emotional design.

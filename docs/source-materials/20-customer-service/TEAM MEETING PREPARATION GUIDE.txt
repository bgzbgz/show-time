[MODULE:STRATEGY EXECUTION - SPRINT:CUSTOMER SERVICE STRATEGY]
TEAM MEETING PREPARATION GUIDE 














[01/06]
Purpose of the Meeting
Objectives
This sprint is designed to transform customer service into a strategic execution tool, not a reactive function.
You will use the Customer Journey Tool to:
Map key service touchpoints across the full customer experience 
Identify three WOW moments to create emotional impact
Define three Just Better improvements to outperform expectations 
Assign ownership and KPIs for service performance
This sprint builds directly on your value proposition and behavioral segmentation.
The goal is not to improve everything, it is to improve what matters most to the right customer.


Participation Expectations
This is a strategy-level meeting, not a service audit. Every participant must:
Come with a draft journey map based on their function or customer touchpoint ownership.
Be prepared to challenge assumptions and defend decisions with customer insight.
Stay fully aligned with the segment, value proposition, and brand tone from the previous sprints.
Push for practical, clear, emotionally grounded execution.

pre-mortem 
Likely failure points
Segment misalignment - designing for “everyone” instead of your actual segment.
Focusing on superficial improvements (tone, scripts) without fixing structural pain points. 
Endless brainstorming with no decisions or prioritization.
Underestimating the emotional impact of inconsistency or slowness.
Preventive actions
Start with the customer segment and value proposition as anchors. 
Use the “WOW” vs “Just Better” distinction to avoid false priorities.
Assign one person to write and one person to time manage.
If conversation drifts, ask:
 “What’s the segment pain this solves?” or “Would they feel this?”

Mental Rehearsal:
High-Impact Participation
Before the meeting, spend 10–15 minutes doing the following mental walkthrough:

1. Visualize the journey
Walk through the customer’s experience from their first contact to post-sale 
At each stage, ask: “What are they trying to achieve?” and “What do they feel?” 
2. Identify the gaps
Think of moments where friction, confusion, or emotion are highest 
Ask yourself: “If I was that customer, would I trust us here?”
3. Rehearse your input
Choose 2–3 moments where you will speak up with clarity and data 
Prepare one non-obvious insight or challenge that will drive the group forward 
4. Practice the close
What will you push to get decided by the end of the sprint? 
What must happen next for execution to begin immediately?

final Reminders
This sprint will only work if everyone comes prepared to think as the customer, speak as the strategist, and act as the operator. Preparation is non-negotiable.

Post-sprint, the Cult Brand promise must be reflected in every customer touchpoint.

If they feel something different than what we promised, we’ve failed.

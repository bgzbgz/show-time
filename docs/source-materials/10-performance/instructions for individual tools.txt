THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS
Tool explanation and guide – FOR REVIEW ONLY
[01/06]
introduction
Imagine a powerful river flowing toward a dam. The water struggles to pass through a single narrow opening, causing a bottleneck that limits the flow. When that bottleneck is cleared, the river flows freely, unlocking immense power downstream. This is the essence of the Theory of Constraints: identifying and resolving the single most critical bottleneck that hinders your system's performance.
[02/06]
TOOL PREVIEW

[03/06]
Purpose  
The Theory of Constraints is a systematic approach to identifying the most significant barrier to achieving a goal and then systematically improving it until it is no longer the limiting factor. Originating from Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt's groundbreaking work, this method empowers teams to unlock their full potential by focusing on what truly matters.
Positive outcomes
Boosts efficiency by focusing on high-impact areas. 
Increases throughput by resolving key blockages.
Enhances team alignment with a shared focus.
Results in faster, more sustainable performance improvements. 
[04/06]
Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Identify the constraint
Examine your processes to pinpoint the step that limits the entire system’s performance.
Question: Which part of the system slows everything else down? 
Example: A manufacturing assembly line where one station consistently causes delays. 
2. Exploit the constraint
Maximize the efficiency of the identified bottleneck without significant investment.
Question: How can we make this step work at its full capacity? 
Example: Adjust work schedules to ensure the constrained station operates continuously. 
3. Subordinate other processes
Align all other steps to support the constraint.
Question: How can the rest of the system synchronize with the bottleneck’s pace?
Example: Reduce the workload on subsequent steps to avoid overwhelming the bottleneck.
4. Elevate the constraint
If the constraint remains, consider investments to expand its capacity.
Question: What resources or innovations can remove this limitation?
Example: Upgrade machinery at the bottleneck station to increase its speed.
5. Repeat the process
Once a constraint is resolved, another will emerge. Continuously improve by repeating these steps.
[05/06]

Main Challenges and Solutions
1. Resistance to change
Example: Staff reluctant to adjust processes
Solution: Highlight quick wins to gain buy-in.
2. Misidentification of constraints
Example: Focusing on minor inefficiencies
Solution: Use data analysis to validate the constraint.
3. Overloading the bottleneck
Example: Assigning too many resources prematurely
Solution: Balance workload and monitor closely.
[06/06]


f.a.q. and answers

1. How do I know I’ve found the real constraint?
Look for the point where work piles up or delays occur frequently. Validate with data before taking action.
2. Can constraints change over time?
Yes, resolving one bottleneck often reveals another. Continuous improvement is key.
3. What if I can’t change the constraint?
Focus on exploiting and subordinating. Often, small adjustments yield significant results.

This session is critical for strengthening our organizational backbone. Now that we’ve identified our core activities and processes, it’s time to define the decisions that drive them and the capabilities required to execute them with excellence. The more aligned we are in these areas, the faster and more accurately we will move as a team. Your preparation and participation will directly impact the clarity and quality of our collective work.

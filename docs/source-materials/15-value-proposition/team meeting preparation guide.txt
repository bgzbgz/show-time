[MODULE:STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT - SPRINT:VALUE PROPOSITION]
TEAM MEETING PREPARATION GUIDE 














[01/05]
Purpose of the Meeting
Objective
This team meeting is designed to ensure that everyone is aligned on crafting a clear, compelling, and differentiated value proposition that:
Directly addresses the target segment’s pains and needs. 
Eliminates fluff and generic claims to ensure our message stands out. 
Clearly differentiates us from competitors and strengthens our market positioning. 
Aligns all teams—marketing, sales, product—under one sharp message.
Why this matters
 A strong value proposition drives customer acquisition, retention, and pricing power.
Without a clear value proposition, customers get confused and choose competitors. 
Ensuring everyone on the team is on the same page will lead to faster execution and stronger customer impact.

Pre-Mortem
Potential issues that could derail the meeting
Team misalignment: if different departments have different ideas of what our value proposition is, discussions will go in circles.
Focusing on features instead of outcomes: customers don’t care about what we do; they care about what they get.
Too many ideas, no focus: if we don’t refine and simplify, we risk a vague, weak message. 
Lack of real customer insights: making assumptions instead of using validated data can lead to an irrelevant value proposition.
Preventive strategies
Come prepared with a draft value proposition: each participant should bring a one-sentence draft using the fast track value proposition formula: for [target segment] who struggle with [pain point], we provide [solution] that [delivers core benefit], unlike [competitor’s weakness].
Keep discussions focused on clarity and impact: use customer insights to refine rather than debate abstract concepts.
Prioritize: the best value proposition is simple, sharp, and memorable—cut everything that is unnecessary. 
Reality check: ask, “would our ideal customer immediately understand this?” If not, it needs work.

final Reminders
Stay Focused on Customer Impact: The best value propositions speak directly to customer pains and desired outcomes.
Simplicity Wins: If it takes more than a sentence to explain, it’s not clear enough.
Prepare to Cut Ruthlessly: If a word doesn’t add value, remove it.
A great value proposition is like a great movie trailer—it grabs attention, builds excitement, and makes people want more.

Purpose of this Preparation
To ensure each team member arrives at the sprint with a clear understanding of the product’s value proposition, customer segment, and brand promise.
To gather all relevant insights and data about current and potential RTM options, including strengths, gaps, risks, and margin structure.
To enable a fast, strategic, and well-informed decision on which 1–2 RTMs should lead product execution for the next phase.

What to Prepare Before the Meeting
Key concepts to review
RTM is strategy in action: it’s how your product promise reaches the customer. 
Every RTM is a trade-off: margin, control, speed, trust, reach, no route optimizes all.
Start with the value proposition: if your RTM weakens it, it's the wrong route.
RTM shapes your org structure: the team, content, and operations must fit the channel 

Pre-reading and materials
RTM Brain Juice (Products) – The strategic foundation for the sprint. 
RTM Deep Dive Summary – Key ideas from books, articles, and videos that support and expand Fast Track principles.
Fast Track VP–RTM Fit Filter – Five essential criteria to test any RTM.
Your Product’s Value Proposition – Revisit your final statement and supporting customer insight.

What to Prepare and Bring
1. Segment Insights
The target customer’s most likely habits: where they shop, how they discover new products, what builds trust.
Any past testing data, persona maps, or survey results.
2. RTM Options Under Consideration
List all realistic options for product delivery: D2C, e-commerce, pharmacy, retail chains, marketplace, subscription, distributor.
Note any prior performance, cost, or operational experience with each.
3. Strengths, Gaps, or Risks for Each Route
Where are you strong already? 
Where do you lack people, tools, partnerships, or capabilities? 
4. Profitability Estimates (if known)
For each RTM option, estimate gross margin, fixed investment, variable costs (if available). 
Identify pricing constraints or commission structures that may apply.

Questions to Answer Before the Sprint
You must be able to answer the following during the session:
What segment are we targeting and where do they already buy? 
What promise are we making to them, and how must that be delivered?
Which RTMs could deliver that promise with consistency, speed, and trust?
What capabilities do we already have? What are we missing?
What margins and operational complexity come with each channel?

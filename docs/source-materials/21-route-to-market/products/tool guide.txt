Purpose
This tool helps the team:
Visually map and compare all realistic RTM options (offline and online)
Break down each route into sequential execution steps
Link every RTM back to the end consumer and brand promise
Align distribution decisions with strategic priorities—not just operational reach 

[02/05]
When to Use
Use the tool during the Scenario Testing and Final Decision phases of your RTM Sprint:
After you’ve scored and filtered your RTM options using the RTM Fit Filter 
Before committing to 1–2 lead routes that will be piloted or scaled

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Populate Realistic RTM Routes
Start with the “COMPANY” cell (row 9, column C). 
For each RTM being considered, map it horizontally, 1 row per route:
Fill in Step 1 through Step 4 with the actual entities (e.g., Regional Distributor, Large Retail Chain, Online Marketplace).
If your RTM is shorter or longer, leave unused steps blank or add cells.
Use arrows to show flow clearly toward the consumer.
2. Mark Channel Type
In column I (“Offline Channels”) or column J (“Online Channels”), tick or label the type of route. 
Helps track whether the RTM is being built around physical presence, digital funnel, or hybrid logic.
3. Validate Strategic Fit
Next to each route, assess:
Does it deliver our value proposition?
Is it consistent with our price, margin, and brand promise?
Do we have (or can we build) the capabilities to execute this route? 
4. Link Back to End Consumer
Ensure that all arrows and flows end at the “END CONSUMER” node. 
Confirm that from Step 1 through Step 4, nothing breaks trust, margin, or clarity.

[MODULE:STRATEGY EXECUTION - SPRINT:ROUTE TO MARKET - SERVICES]
TEAM MEETING PREPARATION GUIDE 














[01/04]
Purpose of this Preparation
To ensure that every sprint participant arrives with a clear understanding of the service promise, target segment, and customer journey.
To gather the right RTM options, insights, and constraints for structured decision-making.
To enable a focused, fact-based sprint discussion that leads to alignment on the 1–2 lead RTMs, as well as what will be required to execute them effectively.

What Makes RTM Different for Services
RTM is not just distribution - it is part of the service experience. 
In services, RTM must build trust before the service is even delivered. 
Customer touchpoints are the brand. You are not shipping a product - you are shaping a relationship from the very first step.
You must align RTM with price point, promise, and complexity - automated sales flows rarely work for premium or advisory services.

What to Prepare and Bring
1. Segment Insights
How the customer actually chooses services like this - what builds trust, how long the cycle is, what stops them.
2. RTM Options Under Consideration
3–5 viable RTMs (referrals, inbound, consult-led, community-led, partnerships, marketplaces, etc.)
3. Delivery and Cost Implications
For each RTM: can we deliver what we promise? What people, tools, or assets are required?
4. Customer Feedback/Data
If available: buyer interviews, past conversion data, referral success, content traction.
5. Pricing and Positioning Match
RTMs that support your price point and tone. Is it personal enough? Is it too slow or too cold for your brand?

Meeting Agenda
Proposed Meeting agenda
Total duration: 90 minutes

1. Kickoff & Alignment (10 mins)
Recap value proposition and segment. Frame why RTM is a strategic act of trust-building.
2. RTM Mapping (15 mins)
Brainstorm and list all candidate RTMs. Categorize by type (referral-based, content-led, outbound, partnerships).
3. Fit Filter Testing (20 mins)
Score each RTM using the 5-question Fit Filter. Eliminate routes that weaken the promise.
4. Scenario Testing (20 mins)
For top 2–3 routes, explore what delivery and scale would require. What gaps must we fill?
5. Decision and Alignment (15 mins)
Pick the lead RTM(s) and define why. Ensure every voice aligns.
6. Wrap-Up and Next Steps (10 mins)
Assign owners, plan execution path, and book the 30-day checkpoint for validation or feedback loop.

Questions Every Team Member Should Be Ready to Answer
You must be able to answer the following during the session:
How does our ideal customer discover and build trust in services like this? 
Which RTM(s) allow us to deliver the promise consistently, not just win the deal?
Do we have the resources and systems to support this channel now - or can we build them? 
Will this RTM scale with clarity or create bottlenecks, handoff issues, or brand damage?
Does this route support our pricing and tone, or does it create mismatch and churn?

final Reminders
Roles and responsibilities
Sprint Leader/Guru: Keep team grounded in the value proposition, not preference. Push for focus and alignment.
Service Owner: Represent the integrity of the offer - does this RTM truly deliver it? Flag any risks.
Marketing Lead: Bring data on customer journey, engagement, and content traction across RTMs.
Sales/BD: Speak to conversion dynamics, lead quality, and deal close triggers.
Delivery/Ops: Flag any constraints (team, systems, onboarding tools) that would affect RTM performance.

Final check
Have I read the RTM Brain Juice and Deep Dive? 
Have I identified realistic RTM options with their implications?
Do I know how our customer evaluates and decides?
Can I explain which RTMs would support delivery, not just lead generation? 
Am I prepared to recommend, not just observe?
If you arrive with clarity, this sprint will align your team around a winning route that’s built on trust, execution, and strategic focus.

If you don’t, you risk choosing speed over scale and killing long-term brand value.

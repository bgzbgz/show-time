Purpose
This tool helps the team:
Visually map and compare all realistic RTM options (offline and online).
Break down each route into sequential execution steps.
Link every RTM back to the end consumer and brand promise.
Map service routes to see how they build trust and deliver value. Select the most effective path for clients to discover, assess, and engage with your service.

When to Use
Use the tool during the Scenario Testing and Final Decision phases of your RTM Sprint:
After you’ve scored and filtered your RTM options using the RTM Fit Filter 
Before committing to 1–2 lead routes that will be piloted or scaled

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Populate Realistic RTM Routes
Brainstorm all possible ways clients could discover, evaluate, and buy your service. Include direct sales, referrals, partners, online platforms, community, consultant-led, etc.
Group similar routes (e.g., all partner types). Keep the list focused on high-potential paths.
Create a raw list of all service RTM ideas.
2. Define the client journey for each option
For each listed RTM, map the specific steps a client takes from first contact to successful delivery and potential retention.
Identify key touchpoints where trust is built or broken.
3. Apply the service RTM fit filter
Score each RTM option against critical service criteria: Does it build trust? Does it match how clients evaluate services? Does it support your price and brand? Can you execute it? Is the capacity viable?
Use brutal honesty. Eliminate routes that clearly fail key tests.
Use the 5-question fit filter to narrow the list to 1-2 top contenders.
Step 4: Scenario test top RTM options
For the remaining 1-2 RTMs, detail what it takes to make them win. Identify required resources, talent, tech, and operational steps.
Test against potential constraints: Can you deliver at scale? Do you have the right team? Is the tech ready?
Build a mini-plan for launching and scaling each top RTM candidate.

example routes
RTM option: direct-to-client via self-serve saas portal (online)
Channel type: digital platform
Step 1: Client discovers the platform via content/ads.
Step 2: Client signs up for a free trial or demo.
Step 3: Client uses the platform and engages with the onboarding flow.
Step 4: Client converts to paid plan via in-app purchase.
Step 5: Client uses the service, interacts with the client success via chat/email.
Actor: client success interacts with end user.
Key checkpoints: trial conversion rate, platform stickiness, support ticket resolution time, feature adoption rate, and monthly recurring revenue.
RTM option: enterprise sale via channel partner with on-site implementation (offline + online)
Channel type: hybrid (in-person + digital)
Step 1: Channel partner identifies lead and makes initial contact (offline).
Step 2: Joint sales calls with partner and your sales team (offline/online).
Step 3: Contract signed, handover to implementation partner (offline).
Step 4: Implementation partner conducts on-site setup and training (offline).
Step 5: Handover to client success team for ongoing support (online).
Step 6: Client Success manages the relationship, supports end users (online).
Actor: Implementation partner hands off to client success, supports end user.
Key checkpoints: partner deal velocity, implementation project duration, client go-live success, support usage post-handover, client satisfaction with implementation and ongoing support, renewal rate.

final review before decision

After all candidate routes are mapped:
Resource allocation: Confirm that dedicated talent is assigned (sales, implementation, client success), tech investment is planned, and necessary content (training, guides) exists.
Talent: check for required skill sets (enterprise sales, technical setup, relationship management). Ensure teams are trained for this specific RTM path.
Tooling: Verify that the software stack supports the RTM (CRM, project management, support) and ensure that integrations work.
Client experience metrics: Define how you will measure success from the client's perspective (onboarding speed, support quality, outcome achievement, retention). Be brutally honest here. Does the RTM deliver the promise or dilute it?

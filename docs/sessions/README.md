# docs/sessions/

Session reports from each Claude Code working session.

## What these contain

Each report covers: what was built, decisions made, bugs found and fixed, patterns established, and what's pending. Read before starting a new session to avoid repeating decisions or missing context.

## Reports

| File | Date | Key work |
|---|---|---|
| `SESSION-REPORT-2026-02-18.md` | 18 Feb 2026 | Initial setup, WOOP tool, Supabase integration |
| `SESSION-REPORT-2026-02-20.md` | 20 Feb 2026 | Tool rewrites, cognitive load system |
| `SESSION-REPORT-2026-02-20-afternoon.md` | 20 Feb 2026 (PM) | Continued tool builds |
| `SESSION-REPORT-2026-02-24.md` | 24 Feb 2026 | Guru suite, AI suggestions, question keys, JSON display |

## Naming convention

`SESSION-REPORT-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — append `-afternoon` or `-2` if there are multiple sessions on the same day.

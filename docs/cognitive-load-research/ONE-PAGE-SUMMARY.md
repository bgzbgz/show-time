## 💬 DAY 1 - RUN 3 PROMPTS (1 hour)
**File:** `../prompts/ESSENTIAL-PROMPTS-ONLY.md`  
**Action:** Copy-paste into ChatGPT/Perplexity/Claude

**Prompt 2:** Get 5 real examples (Typeform, Linear, etc.)  
**Prompt 3:** Validate your info box approach  

**Save everything in ONE Google Doc**

## 📖 DAY 2-5 - REFERENCE WHILE WORKING
**File:** `COGNITIVE-LOAD-PLAYBOOK.md`  
**Use:** Pin to monitor, look up as needed

## 🚨 WHEN YOU'RE TEMPTED TO DO MORE

**Read this:**

❌ "I should research more patterns..."  
✅ No. Run the 3 prompts. That's enough.

❌ "I should analyze 10 more tools..."  
✅ No. Prompt 2 gives you 5. That's enough.

❌ "I should read academic papers on cognitive load..."  
✅ No. The playbook has the principles. That's enough.

❌ "I should fix all 31 tools at once..."  
✅ No. WOOP only. Then repeat process for others.

❌ "I should code before boss approves mockups..."  
✅ No. Get approval first. Always.

**Remember: Less research, more execution.**

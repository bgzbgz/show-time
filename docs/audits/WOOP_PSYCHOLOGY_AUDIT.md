# WOOP Tool Psychology Alignment Audit
## vs. "Imprisoned Athlete CEO" Target Client Profile

**Audit Date:** 2026-02-20
**Tool:** `frontend/tools/module-0-intro-sprint/00-woop.html`
**Auditor:** Fast Track Psychology Alignment Review
**Verdict:** FAILING. Major misalignment with target client. Reads like a coaching worksheet, not an elite execution weapon.

---

## SECTION A: FIRST IMPRESSION AUDIT

### 1. The 30-Second Test (Score: 3/10)

The Imprisoned Athlete CEO opens this tool at 4:47 AM. They have 30 seconds before deciding if this is worth their time or another consultant's toy.

**What they see:**
- Title: "WOOP -- Your Productivity Multiplier"
- Cover subtitle: "Transform your wish into an actionable plan"
- Button: "START"

**What they think:** "Productivity multiplier? That is a LinkedIn headline. 'Transform your wish'? I do not have wishes. I have targets. This feels like it was built for middle managers."

**Problems:**
- "Productivity Multiplier" is generic. Every app on the planet claims this. Zero identity signal.
- "Transform your wish into an actionable plan" uses passive construction ("transform...into"), soft noun ("wish"), and generic noun ("actionable plan"). Three strikes.
- No time estimate on the cover. This CEO has Time Investment Anxiety (Resistance #2). They will not start something without knowing the cost.
- No credibility signal. No CEO proof. No metric. No reason to believe this is different from the 47 other goal-setting tools they have seen.
- The cover image is a generic background photo with 50% opacity. Nothing signals "built for people like you."

**What it should feel like:** Walking into a war room. Black. Sharp. One number. One command.

### 2. Identity Recognition (Score: 2/10)

The Imprisoned Athlete CEO needs to see themselves in the first 5 seconds. They need to feel: "This was built for someone operating at my level."

**Current identity signals:** Zero.

- No reference to revenue, team size, or operational complexity
- No language that distinguishes a CEO from a student, freelancer, or middle manager
- "Everyday Productivity" mode name sounds like a Notion template
- The word "wish" appears 12+ times. CEOs at this level do not use the word "wish." They use "target," "objective," "outcome."
- "How do you feel about it?" -- this is the single most alienating question you can ask someone with Vulnerability Aversion (Resistance #5). This CEO quantifies feelings. They do not explore them.
- No athletic or military metaphors anywhere in the tool
- No competitive framing. No "while your competitors are still planning, you will be executing."

**The identity test:** If you removed the Fast Track branding, could you tell this tool was built for a $50M CEO vs. a startup founder vs. a college student? No. It is identity-agnostic. That is a fatal flaw.

### 3. Language Audit (Score: 3/10)

**Forbidden words found:**

| Forbidden Word | Location | Exact Quote |
|---|---|---|
| "Journey" | Sidebar label (line 487) | `"Your journey"` |
| "Journey" | Step 4 hint (line 1302) | `"Break down your journey"` |
| "Aspirations" | Setup page (line 817) | `"WOOP turns aspirations into concrete action"` |

**Power words used:** Partial credit.

| Power Word | Found? | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Surgical | No | -- |
| Systematic | No | -- |
| Relentless | No | -- |
| Execute | Partial | "Time to execute" in closing messages (lines 766, 768) |
| Dominate | No | -- |
| Elite | No | -- |
| Peak | No | -- |
| Architect | No | -- |
| Build | Partial | Used in example placeholders only |
| Scale | No | -- |

**Power word score: 1/10.** Two partial uses out of 10 required power words.

**Sentence length audit:**
- Target: 8-12 words max, staccato, active voice, period dominance
- Actual: Most hint text runs 15-25 words. Some insight boxes exceed 30 words per sentence.
- Example violation: "Mental contrasting increases goal achievement by 40% vs. positive thinking alone. Your brain doesn't differentiate between what's in your head and reality. Make it vivid." -- First sentence is 12 words (acceptable). Second is 14 words (borderline). Third is 3 words (good). Mixed.
- Example violation: "WOOP turns aspirations into concrete action. People who use WOOP daily report 2x higher productivity and follow-through. Pick your mode." -- Second sentence is 14 words (too long).

---

## SECTION B: PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGER ACTIVATION

### Trigger 1: Superiority Paradox
**Status:** MISSING

The Imprisoned Athlete CEO needs to feel they are engaging with something built for the top 1%. Nothing in this tool signals exclusivity.

- No "This is not for everyone" framing
- No "Most CEOs skip this step" competitive positioning
- No difficulty signal that makes completion feel like achievement
- The tool feels equally appropriate for an intern and a CEO
- **Fix:** Add superiority framing to cover: "96% of CEOs set goals. 4% build execution systems. This is for the 4%."

### Trigger 2: Time Compression
**Status:** WEAK

- Time estimates exist per step (~3 min, ~5 min) -- good
- Total time shown in sidebar (~15 min or ~22 min) -- good
- But no urgency language. No "complete in one sitting" demand
- No "you will have a locked execution plan in 15 minutes" promise on the cover
- No contrast with how long alternatives take ("Most strategic planning takes weeks. This takes 15 minutes.")
- **Fix:** Add time compression promise to cover. Add urgency language to closing messages.

### Trigger 3: Competitive Intelligence
**Status:** MISSING

Zero competitive framing anywhere in the tool.

- No "your competitors" language
- No market positioning context
- No "while they deliberate, you execute" framing
- No industry benchmarks
- The insight boxes cite academic research but never frame it competitively
- **Fix:** Reframe insight boxes from "research shows X" to "top performers do X. The rest do Y."

### Trigger 4: Control Recovery
**Status:** WEAK

- The IF-THEN obstacle planning (Step 3) is inherently about control recovery -- good structural element
- But the language does not frame it as control recovery
- "Anticipate Obstacles" is passive. Should be "Neutralize Threats" or "Eliminate Risks"
- No framing around "you are currently reactive. This makes you proactive."
- The Pre-mortem (Step 5) is excellent structurally but the language is academic, not visceral
- **Fix:** Reframe obstacle language around control. "Right now, surprises control your schedule. After this step, nothing catches you off guard."

### Trigger 5: Identity Validation
**Status:** MISSING

The CEO needs to feel validated as a high performer who just needs a better system, not more education.

- No acknowledgment of their current success
- No "you already know this intuitively -- this makes it systematic" framing
- Setup text says "People who use WOOP daily report 2x higher productivity" -- this implies they currently have low productivity. Insulting.
- No "for operators who have outgrown their current system" positioning
- **Fix:** Replace productivity framing with upgrade framing. "You built something significant. This tool matches your execution system to your ambition."

### Trigger 6: Time Arbitrage
**Status:** MISSING

No ROI framing. No "invest 15 minutes, save 15 hours" positioning. No time-value calculation.

- The CEO needs to see the arbitrage: small time input, massive time output
- Currently the tool just says how long it takes, not what it saves
- **Fix:** Add to cover or setup: "15 minutes now. 15 hours saved this quarter. That is the exchange rate."

### Trigger 7: Anti-Conventional
**Status:** MISSING

Nothing positions this tool as different from conventional goal-setting.

- WOOP is actually contrarian (mental contrasting vs. positive thinking) but the tool never frames it that way
- No "this is not goal-setting" declaration
- No "forget everything consultants told you about strategic planning"
- The insight boxes mention "vs. positive thinking alone" but bury the contrarian angle
- **Fix:** Lead with the contrarian angle. "Positive thinking kills execution. This tool does the opposite."

**TRIGGER SCORECARD:**

| # | Trigger | Status | Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Superiority Paradox | MISSING | 0/10 |
| 2 | Time Compression | WEAK | 4/10 |
| 3 | Competitive Intelligence | MISSING | 0/10 |
| 4 | Control Recovery | WEAK | 3/10 |
| 5 | Identity Validation | MISSING | 0/10 |
| 6 | Time Arbitrage | MISSING | 0/10 |
| 7 | Anti-Conventional | MISSING | 0/10 |

**Total Trigger Score: 7/70 (10%)**

---

## SECTION C: RESISTANCE VIOLATION CHECK

### Resistance 1: Education Fatigue
**Status:** VIOLATED

- Yellow Insight boxes read like textbook citations: "Mental contrasting increases goal achievement by 40%..." -- this is education, not activation
- Setup text educates: "WOOP turns aspirations into concrete action" -- the CEO does not need to be told what the tool does. They need to use it.
- Step 2 insight: "Lewis Hamilton mentally drives each lap before stepping in the car" -- education through anecdote. Better, but still teaching.
- **Fix:** Reframe insights from "here is what research says" to "here is what you should do, and here is why it works, in one line."

### Resistance 2: Time Investment Anxiety
**Status:** FIX NEEDED

- Time estimates per step: good (addresses anxiety)
- No time estimate on the cover page: bad (anxiety hits before they start)
- No "complete in one sitting" promise
- No "you will have X in 15 minutes" outcome promise
- The setup page adds a step before the user even begins. More steps = more anxiety.
- **Fix:** Add time estimate and outcome promise to cover. Collapse setup into cover if possible.

### Resistance 3: Skepticism of Consultants
**Status:** VIOLATED

- No peer proof. No CEO testimonials. No "built by operators, not consultants."
- Academic citations (40%, 300%, 42%) feel like consultant ammunition
- No social proof anywhere in the tool
- The "2x higher productivity" claim on setup page has no source attribution -- feels like marketing
- **Fix:** Replace academic framing with peer proof. "CEOs who complete this step report X" or name-drop recognizable operators.

### Resistance 4: Change Disruption Fear
**Status:** AVOIDED

- The tool is additive, not disruptive. It does not ask the CEO to change their current systems.
- It asks them to plan, not restructure.
- Good: the closing messages reinforce what was accomplished at each step (incremental progress).

### Resistance 5: Vulnerability Aversion
**Status:** VIOLATED

- "How do you feel about it?" -- direct vulnerability prompt. This is the single worst question for this persona.
- "Name the emotion. Even one powerful word counts." -- the error message doubles down on emotional exploration.
- "Close your eyes. Picture yourself completing each milestone. See the details. Feel the momentum." -- guided meditation language. This CEO does crossfit at 5 AM. They do not close their eyes at their desk.
- **Fix:** Reframe "How do you feel about it?" to "What state are you in when this is done?" Reframe the mental rehearsal from meditation to athletic visualization.

### Resistance 6: Balance BS
**Status:** AVOIDED

- No mentions of work-life balance, wellness, or self-care.
- The "Everyday Productivity" mode name skirts close to this territory but does not violate it.

### Resistance 7: Generic Solutions
**Status:** VIOLATED

- The entire tool is identity-agnostic. It works equally for a student and a CEO.
- No customization based on company size, revenue, or team size
- Examples use generic business scenarios, not CEO-specific ones
- "Do better at sales" vs. "Close 3 enterprise deals" -- the good example is better but still generic
- **Fix:** Add CEO-specific examples throughout. Reference board meetings, leadership teams, quarterly targets, M&A decisions.

### Resistance 8: Slow Implementation
**Status:** FIX NEEDED

- The tool itself is fast (15-22 minutes). Good structure.
- But the cover does not communicate speed. The CEO does not know it is fast until they are already in the setup page.
- No "done in one sitting" promise
- **Fix:** Lead with speed on the cover. "Locked execution plan. 15 minutes. One sitting."

### Resistance 9: Theoretical Frameworks
**Status:** VIOLATED

- "WOOP" is an acronym from psychology research (Gabriele Oettingen). The tool never acknowledges this, which is fine.
- But the Yellow Insight boxes are pure theory: "The Zeigarnik Effect: once you start a task, your brain becomes obsessed with completing it." This is a textbook definition.
- "Mental contrasting increases goal achievement by 40%" -- theory
- "IF-THEN plans increase follow-through by up to 300%" -- theory
- The CEO does not care about the Zeigarnik Effect. They care about finishing the plan.
- **Fix:** Strip theory labels. Replace "The Zeigarnik Effect: once you start a task..." with "Start one thing. Your brain will not let you stop."

### Resistance 10: Committee Thinking
**Status:** AVOIDED

- The tool is explicitly individual. No group exercises, no team alignment steps.
- "Strategy is sacrifice -- only 3" reinforces individual decisive action. Good.

**RESISTANCE SCORECARD:**

| # | Resistance | Status | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Education Fatigue | VIOLATED | Insight boxes teach instead of activate |
| 2 | Time Investment Anxiety | FIX NEEDED | No time/outcome promise on cover |
| 3 | Skepticism of Consultants | VIOLATED | Academic citations, no peer proof |
| 4 | Change Disruption Fear | AVOIDED | Tool is additive |
| 5 | Vulnerability Aversion | VIOLATED | "How do you feel?" is a direct hit |
| 6 | Balance BS | AVOIDED | No balance language |
| 7 | Generic Solutions | VIOLATED | Identity-agnostic tool |
| 8 | Slow Implementation | FIX NEEDED | Speed not communicated on cover |
| 9 | Theoretical Frameworks | VIOLATED | Insight boxes cite theory by name |
| 10 | Committee Thinking | AVOIDED | Individual tool |

**Violations: 5 | Fixes Needed: 2 | Avoided: 3**

## SECTION D: CONTENT PSYCHOLOGY AUDIT

### 1. Opening Hook Analysis + Rewrite

**CURRENT (Cover Page):**
```
WOOP
Transform your wish into an actionable plan
[START]
```

**Problems:**
- "Transform" is passive transformation language. CEOs do not transform. They build, execute, dominate.
- "your wish" -- CEOs do not have wishes. They have targets, outcomes, objectives.
- "actionable plan" -- every plan should be actionable. This is redundant filler. Like saying "wet water."
- No time promise. No outcome promise. No identity signal. No reason to click START.

**REWRITE:**
```
WOOP
Lock your next 90-day execution plan. 15 minutes.
[EXECUTE]
```

**CURRENT (Setup Page):**
```
Before We Start
WOOP turns aspirations into concrete action. People who use WOOP daily report
2x higher productivity and follow-through. Pick your mode.
```

**Problems:**
- "Before We Start" -- the CEO already clicked START. Making them wait triggers Time Investment Anxiety.
- "aspirations" -- soft word. CEOs have objectives, not aspirations.
- "People who use WOOP daily" -- who are these people? No specificity. Feels like marketing copy.
- "2x higher productivity" -- unattributed claim. Triggers Skepticism of Consultants.
- "Pick your mode" -- passive. "Select" or "Choose" is more decisive.

**REWRITE:**
```
Select Your Mode
Two paths. Pick one. 15 minutes to a locked plan.
```

### 2. Field Labels Audit + Rewrites

| Current Label | Problem | Rewrite |
|---|---|---|
| "What have you achieved?" | Past tense is good. But "achieved" is generic. | "What did you accomplish?" or "Name the target you hit." |
| "How has the world changed?" | Vague. "World" is too abstract. | "What is different in your business?" |
| "How do you feel about it?" | Vulnerability trigger. Direct emotional probe. | "What state are you operating in?" |
| "Define Your Wish" (Step 1 heading) | "Wish" is soft. | "Define Your Target" |
| "Map the Outcome" (Step 2 heading) | "Map" is acceptable. "Outcome" is fine. | Keep or change to "Lock the Outcome" |
| "Anticipate Obstacles" (Step 3 heading) | "Anticipate" is passive. | "Neutralize Threats" |
| "Create Your Plan" (Step 4 heading) | "Create" is weak. | "Lock Your Plan" |
| "Big chunks of work" | Informal. "Chunks" is sloppy language. | "Critical work streams" |
| "Smallest first action" | Good concept. "Smallest" could feel diminishing. | "First move" |
| "By when?" | Too casual. | "Deadline" (one word, no question mark) |
| "The Problem" (obstacle label) | Generic. | "The Threat" |
| "Mental Rehearsal" | Sounds like therapy. | "Pre-execution Visualization" |
| "How do you want to use WOOP?" | Question format is passive. | "Select your execution mode" |
| "Completing the Fast Track Program" | Descriptive, fine. | Keep. |
| "Everyday Productivity" | Generic. Sounds like a blog post title. | "Single-Target Execution" |
| "What is your elephant?" | Metaphor is clear but the question is casual. | "What is the target that is stalling you?" |

### 3. Help Text Audit

| Current Help Text | Problem | Rewrite |
|---|---|---|
| "So small it feels silly. Under 30 minutes. Impossible to fail at." | Good staccato rhythm. "Silly" is the wrong register for a CEO. | "Under 30 minutes. No dependencies. No excuses." |
| "A goal without a deadline is a wish. Pick a date." | "Wish" again. But the structure is sharp. | "No date, no commitment. Lock it." |
| "Close your eyes. Picture yourself completing each milestone. See the details. Feel the momentum." | Guided meditation. Wrong register entirely. | "Walk through each milestone in your head. See who is in the room. See the number on the board. Done." |
| "Describe the result. Not the steps -- the destination." | Good. Sharp. Keep. | Keep as-is. |
| "Specific actions. Assign owners. Set check-in dates." | Excellent. Staccato. Decisive. Keep. | Keep as-is. |
| "One action. One sitting. Start before you feel ready." | Good rhythm. "Feel ready" edges toward emotional. | "One action. One sitting. Start now." |
| "The big, overwhelming goal that feels impossible to start." | "Overwhelming" and "feels impossible" are emotional/victim language. | "The target that keeps getting pushed to next quarter." |
| "Each slice should take 15-60 minutes. Small enough to start right now." | Acceptable. Could be sharper. | "15-60 minutes per slice. No excuses for delay." |

### 4. Error Messages Audit + Rewrites

| Current Error | Problem | Rewrite |
|---|---|---|
| "There is a problem" (error summary header) | Passive. Apologetic. Generic. The UK government GDS pattern. Wrong tone for this audience. | "Incomplete." (one word) |
| "Describe your achievement in at least 20 characters." | Character count is irrelevant to CEOs. They do not think in characters. | "Be specific. Numbers. Names. Dates." |
| "Name the emotion. Even one powerful word counts." | Reinforces emotional exploration. Double violation of Vulnerability Aversion. | "Name your operating state. One word." |
| "Mentally rehearse each step before proceeding." | "Proceeding" is bureaucratic. | "Visualize each milestone before moving on." |
| "Set a deadline. Date = Reality." | Good. Sharp. Keep. | Keep as-is. |
| "Select your focus before starting." | Fine. Neutral. | Keep as-is. |
| "Define milestone 1 (at least 6 characters)." | Character count again. | "Define milestone 1. Be specific." |
| "Describe a specific obstacle (at least 6 characters)." | Character count. | "Name a specific threat." |
| "Could not generate suggestions. Try again." | Passive failure message. | "AI generation failed. Retry." |

### 5. CTA Buttons Audit + Rewrites

| Current CTA | Problem | Rewrite |
|---|---|---|
| "START" (cover) | Acceptable but generic. | "EXECUTE" |
| "Start ->" (setup) | "Start" appears twice (cover + setup). Redundant. Soft. | "BEGIN" or "GO" |
| "Next ->" (step navigation) | Generic wizard pattern. | "CONTINUE" or "LOCK & PROCEED" |
| "<- Back" | Fine. Standard. | Keep. |
| "AI Coach Reviewing..." | "Coach" is a consultant word. Triggers Resistance #3. | "AI Analyzing..." |
| "View Your Canvas" (final step) | "View" is passive. "Canvas" is art language. | "See Your Execution Plan" |
| "Export PDF" | Fine. Functional. | Keep. |
| "Final Submit" | "Submit" implies someone else is in charge. | "LOCK & DEPLOY" |

---

## SECTION E: MISSING PSYCHOLOGICAL ELEMENTS

### 1. Insight Boxes Quality

**Current state:** Academic citations masquerading as activation. Every insight box follows the pattern: "[Study/Effect name]: [What research found]. [One-line directive]."

**What is missing:**
- Competitive framing ("Top 4% of operators do this. The rest skip it.")
- Peer proof ("A CEO running a $40M logistics company used this exact step to cut planning time by 60%.")
- Consequence language ("Skip this step and you will spend the next quarter reacting instead of executing.")

**Recommended insight box formula for this persona:**
```
[Sharp observation about their reality]. [What top performers do differently]. [One command].
```

### 2. Brutal Honesty Prompts

**Current state:** Zero. The tool is polite throughout.

**What is missing:** The Imprisoned Athlete CEO respects directness. They need prompts like:
- "If this goal is vague, you already lost. Rewrite it with a number."
- "If you cannot name 3 milestones, you do not have a plan. You have a hope."
- "If your first action takes more than 30 minutes, you are procrastinating with planning."

### 3. Competitive Framing

**Current state:** Zero competitive language anywhere in the tool.

**What is missing:**
- Step 1: "While your competitors set vague goals, you are locking specific targets."
- Step 3: "90% of executives plan for success. The elite plan for failure. That is this step."
- Step 5: "Your competitors do not run pre-mortems. That is your advantage."

### 4. Time Compression Language

**Current state:** Time estimates exist but are informational, not motivational.

**What is missing:**
- Cover: "15 minutes. One sitting. Locked plan."
- Step transitions: "3 minutes to lock this. Go."
- Closing messages: Time-anchored urgency ("Target locked in 3 minutes. Next step: 5 minutes.")

### 5. Peer Proof

**Current state:** Zero. No testimonials, no case studies, no named examples of CEOs using this.

**What is missing:**
- At minimum: one anonymized CEO case per major step
- Example: "A CEO running 200 people and $35M revenue used this exact IF-THEN framework to eliminate 80% of their weekly fires."
- Lewis Hamilton reference in Step 2 is the closest thing to peer proof, but F1 drivers are athletes, not business operators

### 6. Metric/ROI Framing

**Current state:** Some metrics exist (40%, 300%, 42%, 2x) but they are academic, not business-framed.

**What is missing:**
- ROI translation: "This 15-minute exercise replaces a 2-day offsite."
- Business metrics: "CEOs who use IF-THEN plans report 3x fewer emergency meetings per quarter."
- Time-money conversion: "Every obstacle you plan for now saves 4-8 hours of crisis management later."

### 7. Athletic/Military Metaphors

**Current state:** One Lewis Hamilton reference. Nothing else.

**What is missing:**
- "This is your pre-game film review. Athletes do not wing game day."
- "Milestones are checkpoints, not finish lines."
- "The pre-mortem is your war game. Find the weakness before the enemy does."
- "Cut the Elephant is your training split. You do not train everything in one session."

### 8. Anti-Generic Positioning

**Current state:** Nothing differentiates this from any other goal-setting tool.

**What is missing:**
- Explicit anti-positioning: "This is not goal-setting. This is execution architecture."
- Differentiation: "Most planning tools ask what you want. This tool asks what will stop you. That is the difference."
- Anti-conventional framing for WOOP's mental contrasting approach: "Positive visualization feels good. It also kills follow-through. This tool does the opposite."

## SECTION F: WHAT TO REMOVE

### 1. Corporate Jargon

| Current Text | Location | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| "Transform your wish into an actionable plan" | Cover subtitle | "Lock your 90-day execution plan." |
| "WOOP turns aspirations into concrete action" | Setup page | "WOOP builds execution plans. Fast." |
| "People who use WOOP daily report 2x higher productivity and follow-through" | Setup page | Remove entirely or replace with "Operators who run WOOP weekly report 2x follow-through on quarterly targets." |

### 2. Hedging Language

| Current Text | Location | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| "What would the outcome of this task be?" | Step 2 (business mode) hint | "What is the outcome?" (remove "would") |
| "What would the outcome be?" | Step 2 (business mode) label | "What is the outcome?" |
| "Identify what will try to stop you" | Step 3 hint | "Name what will stop you." |
| "Imagine your project has already failed" | Step 5 hint | "Your project failed." (remove "imagine") |

### 3. Education/Learning Language

| Current Text | Location | Problem | Replacement |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Mental contrasting increases goal achievement by 40% vs. positive thinking alone." | Step 1 Yellow Insight | Academic citation format | "Positive thinking kills follow-through. Mental contrasting reverses that. +40% goal completion." |
| "The Zeigarnik Effect: once you start a task, your brain becomes obsessed with completing it." | Step 4 Yellow Insight | Names a psychological theory by name | "Start one task. Your brain locks onto it and will not let go. That is the mechanism." |
| "A pre-mortem flips optimism bias on its head." | Step 5 Yellow Insight | Names a cognitive bias by academic name | "Your brain hides risks when you are optimistic. This step forces them into the open." |
| "IF-THEN plans increase follow-through by up to 300%." | Step 3 Yellow Insight | Academic citation | "Pre-planned responses execute automatically. No willpower needed. 3x more follow-through." |
| "People who write down a specific outcome are 42% more likely to achieve it." | Step 2 (business) Yellow Insight | Generic "people" + academic stat | "Written outcomes get done. 42% more likely. Unwritten ones drift." |

### 4. Balance/Wellness Language

No direct violations found. This is one of the few areas the tool does not fail.

### 5. Generic Business Advice

| Current Text | Location | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| "Be specific -- numbers, names, dates." | Step 1 hint | Not bad, but the most basic advice possible. Every goal-setting guide says this. |
| "Strategy is sacrifice -- only 3." | Step 2 hint | Good line. Keep. One of the few sharp moments in the tool. |
| "A goal without a deadline is a wish." | Step 4 help text | Overused quote. Every productivity blog uses this. |

### 6. Long-Winded Explanations

| Current Text | Word Count | Replacement | Word Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| "WOOP turns aspirations into concrete action. People who use WOOP daily report 2x higher productivity and follow-through. Pick your mode." | 22 words | "Build your execution plan. Select a mode." | 7 words |
| "Mental contrasting increases goal achievement by 40% vs. positive thinking alone. Your brain doesn't differentiate between what's in your head and reality. Make it vivid." | 28 words | "Your brain treats vivid mental images as real. Make this specific. +40% completion rate." | 14 words |
| "Lewis Hamilton mentally drives each lap before stepping in the car. Mental rehearsal activates the same brain regions as physical practice. Visualize completing each milestone." | 26 words | "Hamilton drives every lap in his head before touching the car. Same brain activation. Do this for each milestone." | 18 words |
| "Procrastination comes from overwhelm, not laziness. Teams that break goals into 15-30 minute tasks execute 2x faster. The trick: each slice must be completable in one sitting." | 28 words | "Overwhelm causes paralysis. 15-30 minute slices execute 2x faster. One sitting per slice." | 13 words |

### 4-Question Test

**Q1: Would the Imprisoned Athlete CEO complete this tool at 4:47 AM?**
**FAIL.** The cover gives no reason to believe this is different from the other goal-setting tools they have abandoned. No time promise, no identity signal, no outcome promise. They would close the tab in under 10 seconds.

**Q2: Would they recommend it to a peer CEO?**
**FAIL.** "How do you feel about it?" would make them embarrassed to share. The academic insight boxes would feel like being lectured. No CEO shares a tool that asks about feelings.

**Q3: Would they use it again next week?**
**FAIL.** Nothing in the experience says "come back." No competitive benchmark, no progress tracking across uses, no "beat your last score" framing. The "Everyday Productivity" mode is the right idea (repeat use) but the name and framing kill it.

**Q4: Does it make them feel like an elite operator or a student?**
**FAIL.** A student. The tool teaches, explains, asks about feelings, and uses academic citations. An elite operator tool would command, quantify, and validate.

**4-Question Score: 0/4**

### Imprisoned Athlete Test

**The defining question:** Does this tool feel like it was built by someone who understands what it is like to run a $50M company with 200 employees, wake up at 4:47 AM, and feel trapped by the complexity they built?

**FAIL.**

This tool feels like it was built by someone who read the WOOP research paper and turned it into a clean UI. It is well-built technically. The wizard flow is solid. The IF-THEN planning structure is genuinely useful. The visual design (black/white/yellow) is sharp.

But the words do not match the audience. The tool speaks to a general professional who wants to be more productive. It does not speak to a trapped high-performer who wants systematic liberation. That is a different conversation entirely.

## SECTION H: PRIORITIZED ACTION PLAN

### CRITICAL (Do These First -- Each Violation Actively Repels the Target Client)

**1. Cover Page -- Complete Rewrite**

- **Current:** `"WOOP"` / `"Transform your wish into an actionable plan"` / `[START]`
- **Problem:** Generic title, soft subtitle with forbidden-adjacent language, no time promise, no identity signal, no outcome promise. The cover is the single highest-impact surface. If this fails, nothing else matters.
- **Replacement:**
  ```
  WOOP
  Your 90-day execution plan. Locked in 15 minutes.
  [EXECUTE]
  ```
- **Impact:** 10/10 -- this is the gate. Fix this or lose them at the door.

**2. "How do you feel about it?" -- Direct Vulnerability Violation**

- **Current:** Label: `"How do you feel about it?"` / Error: `"Name the emotion. Even one powerful word counts."`
- **Problem:** The single most alienating question for the Imprisoned Athlete CEO. Triggers Vulnerability Aversion (Resistance #5). This CEO ties self-worth to metrics. Asking them to name feelings in a business tool is like asking a fighter pilot to journal about their emotions mid-flight.
- **Replacement:** Label: `"What state are you operating in when this is done?"` / Error: `"Name your operating state. One word."`
- **Impact:** 9/10 -- this question can single-handedly cause a CEO to mentally dismiss the entire tool.

**3. Sidebar "Your journey" -- Forbidden Word**

- **Current:** Line 487: `"Your journey"`
- **Problem:** "Journey" is an explicitly forbidden word for this persona. It signals coaching/therapy language. Appears in the sidebar which is visible on every single step.
- **Replacement:** `"Your execution plan"` or `"Progress"`
- **Impact:** 8/10 -- visible on every screen, constant subliminal repellent.

**4. Step 4 Hint "Break down your journey" -- Forbidden Word**

- **Current:** Line 1302: `"Break down your journey. Pick the smallest first action. Set a deadline. Date = Reality."`
- **Problem:** Second use of forbidden word "journey." Plus "Break down" is destructive language, not constructive.
- **Replacement:** `"Identify the critical path. Pick the smallest first move. Set a deadline. Date = Reality."`
- **Impact:** 7/10 -- direct content violation in a step the user reads carefully.

**5. Setup Page -- Remove "aspirations" and Education**

- **Current:** `"WOOP turns aspirations into concrete action. People who use WOOP daily report 2x higher productivity and follow-through. Pick your mode."`
- **Problem:** "Aspirations" is soft. The 2x claim is unattributed marketing. "Pick your mode" is passive. The whole block is education, not activation.
- **Replacement:** `"Select your execution mode. 15 minutes to a locked plan."`
- **Impact:** 7/10 -- second screen the user sees. Still a gate moment.

### HIGH PRIORITY (Fix These Within the Same Sprint)

**1. Yellow Insight Boxes -- Strip Theory, Add Competitive Framing**

- **Current pattern:** "[Academic concept]: [Research finding]. [Directive]."
- **Problem:** Triggers Education Fatigue (Resistance #1), Consultant Skepticism (Resistance #3), and Theoretical Frameworks (Resistance #9). Three resistances in one UI element.
- **Replacement pattern:** "[Sharp observation about their reality]. [What the data shows in one number]. [Command]."
- **Example rewrite for Step 1:**
  - Current: "Mental contrasting increases goal achievement by 40% vs. positive thinking alone. Your brain doesn't differentiate between what's in your head and reality. Make it vivid."
  - Rewrite: "Positive thinking feels productive. It is not. Mental contrasting outperforms it by 40%. Be specific. Be vivid. Your brain will treat it as real."
- **Impact:** 7/10 -- insight boxes appear on every step.

**2. Error Summary Header -- "There is a problem"**

- **Current:** `"There is a problem"` (line 430)
- **Problem:** Passive, apologetic, generic. The British government accessibility pattern. Wrong tone for an elite operator.
- **Replacement:** `"Incomplete"` or `"Missing fields"`
- **Impact:** 6/10 -- error state is a critical moment. The wrong tone here feels like the tool is scolding them.

**3. Step Headings -- Upgrade Verb Strength**

- **Current:** "Define Your Wish" / "Map the Outcome" / "Anticipate Obstacles" / "Create Your Plan"
- **Problem:** "Define" is neutral. "Map" is neutral. "Anticipate" is passive. "Create" is weak.
- **Replacement:** "Lock Your Target" / "Lock the Outcome" / "Neutralize Threats" / "Lock Your Plan"
- **Impact:** 6/10 -- headings set the tone for each step.

**4. CTA Buttons -- Upgrade from Generic to Commanding**

- **Current:** "START" / "Start ->" / "Next ->" / "View Your Canvas" / "Final Submit"
- **Replacement:** "EXECUTE" / "BEGIN" / "CONTINUE" / "VIEW EXECUTION PLAN" / "LOCK & DEPLOY"
- **Impact:** 5/10 -- every click is a micro-commitment. The language of the button shapes how the action feels.

**5. Add Competitive Framing to At Least 2 Steps**

- **Currently:** Zero competitive framing.
- **Add to Step 3 insight:** "90% of operators plan for success. The top 4% plan for failure first. That is this step."
- **Add to Step 5 hint:** "Your competitors do not run pre-mortems. That is why they spend Q4 in damage control."
- **Impact:** 6/10 -- Competitive Intelligence (Trigger #3) is completely absent.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Sprint)

**1. Add Time Arbitrage to Cover or Setup**

- **Add:** "15 minutes here replaces a 2-day strategy offsite."
- **Impact:** 5/10 -- addresses missing Trigger #6

**2. Add CEO-Specific Examples**

- **Current examples:** "Close 3 enterprise deals worth 500K total by Q2" -- decent but still generic sales.
- **Upgrade to:** "Reduce leadership team meeting time by 40% this quarter. Three direct reports making autonomous decisions by June." -- CEO-specific language.
- **Impact:** 4/10 -- examples are read but not the primary interface.

**3. Replace Mental Rehearsal Language**

- **Current:** "Close your eyes. Picture yourself completing each milestone. See the details. Feel the momentum."
- **Replacement:** "Walk through each milestone. See who delivers it. See the metric that proves it is done. Confirm."
- **Impact:** 4/10 -- one section of one step, but a tone violation.

### Estimated Impact Summary

| Priority | Items | Est. Alignment Score After Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Current State | -- | 21/100 |

## APPENDIX: COMPLETE FORBIDDEN WORD SCAN

| Word | Occurrences | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| Journey | 2 | Sidebar label (line 487), Step 4 hint (line 1302) |
| Process | 0 | Clean |
| Holistic | 0 | Clean |
| Comprehensive | 0 | Clean |
| Leverage | 0 | Clean |

| Work-life balance | 0 | Clean |

**Near-misses (not forbidden but tonally dangerous):**

| Word | Occurrences | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Aspirations | 1 | Setup page -- soft, coaching-adjacent |
| Wish | 12+ | Throughout -- core WOOP terminology, but reads as soft |
| Feel/Feeling | 4+ | Step 1 label, help text, placeholders -- vulnerability trigger |
| Coach | 1 | "AI Coach Reviewing..." button -- consultant adjacent |
| Overwhelming | 1 | Step 6 help text -- victim language |

**FINAL VERDICT:**

The WOOP tool is structurally sound. The wizard flow, validation system, IF-THEN planning, pre-mortem, and elephant slicing are genuinely valuable execution frameworks. The visual design is clean and on-brand.

The failure is entirely in the words. Every piece of copy reads like it was written for a general professional audience, not for a trapped high-performing CEO. The language educates when it should command. It explores feelings when it should validate competence. It cites theory when it should cite peers. It says "journey" when it should say "execution."

The fix is surgical, not structural. The architecture stays. The words change. That is a 2-3 day copywriting sprint, not a rebuild.

Score: **21/100**. Failing. Fixable.

# VALUE PROPOSITION TOOL -- PSYCHOLOGY ALIGNMENT AUDIT
## Tool: `15-value-proposition.html`
## Target: Imprisoned Athlete CEO Profile
## Auditor: Claude Code | Date: 2026-02-20
## Verdict: SIGNIFICANT MISALIGNMENT -- Requires Overhaul

---

# SECTION A: FIRST IMPRESSION AUDIT

## A1. The 30-Second Test -- Score: 5/10

**What the CEO sees in 30 seconds:**
- Cover: "VALUE PROPOSITION DESIGN" (80px Plaak, white on black with background image)
- Subtitle: "Craft a message that makes customers say 'I need this NOW'"
- Button: "START"
- Time estimate (sidebar): "~40 min"

**What works:**
- The subtitle has urgency: "I need this NOW" is good.
- Black background with large Plaak type matches elite aesthetic.
- Single "START" button is clean and decisive.

**What fails:**
- "VALUE PROPOSITION DESIGN" reads like a university course title. A 4:47 AM CEO does not want to "design" anything. They want to dominate a market.
- "Craft a message" is artisanal language. Craft beer. Craft leather. Not CEO territory.
- ~40 min time estimate is visible in sidebar and signals a time sink. This CEO will bail before starting.
- No ROI hook. No metric. No reason this tool is worth the next 40 minutes of their life.
- No identity signal. Nothing says "this is for elite operators, not MBA students."

**What a 4:47 AM CEO thinks:** "Another value proposition worksheet. I did this in business school."

## A2. Identity Recognition -- Score: 4/10

**Does this tool signal "built for someone like me"?**

The tool speaks to generic business owners, possibly startup founders ("90% of startups fail"). The placeholders reference "High-growth SaaS startups (20-100 employees) with $5M-$30M ARR" -- this is startup language, not scale-up CEO language. The Imprisoned Athlete CEO runs $10M-$250M with 50-500 employees. They are past the startup survival phase.

**Specific failures:**
- No mention of CEO-level decision-making anywhere
- "Company ID" and "Username ID" in setup -- bureaucratic, feels like an IT form
- The word "startups" appears in placeholder text -- alienates the target
- No separation from average. Nothing says "this is elite-level work"
- The "movie trailer" metaphor (Step 3 insight) is pop culture, not executive
- "Understand what keeps your customers awake at night" -- educational framing, talks down to someone who already knows their customer

**What's missing:** Language that says "You already have a VP. It's probably costing you revenue. Let's make it surgical."

## A3. Language Audit -- Score: 4/10

### Power Words Found:
| Word | Location | Assessment |
|------|----------|------------|
| "Precise" | Setup body ("precise, powerful statement") | Good but buried |
| "Dominate" | Step 2 LearnMore ("dominate specific segments") | Good |
| "Sharp" | Step 4 checklist #6 ("sharp, to the point") | Good |
| "Differentiate or die" | Step 2 Insight | Strong. Keep this. |
| "Impossible to ignore" | Cover + Step 3 hint | Good intensity |
| "Brutal" | Step 1 help ("brutally specific") | Good micro-moment |

**Power word count: 6 instances across 1,287 lines. Critically insufficient.**

### Forbidden Words Found:
| Word | Location | Exact Quote | Severity |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **"Journey"** | Sidebar label (line 473) | `"Your journey"` | CRITICAL -- visible on every step |
| **"Holistic"** | Not found | -- | Clean |
| **"Comprehensive"** | Not found | -- | Clean |
| **"Leverage"** | Not found | -- | Clean |
| **"Solutions"** | Step 1 field label | "Current Solutions & Workarounds" | MODERATE -- field label |
| **"Methodologies"** | Not found | -- | Clean |
| **"Best Practices"** | Not found | -- | Clean |
| **"Frameworks"** | Not found | -- | Clean |

**Forbidden word count: 2 violations (1 critical, 1 moderate)**

### Sentence Length Analysis:
- Setup body: "Your value proposition is the backbone of your entire strategy." = 10 words. PASS.
- "It determines who you attract, how much you can charge, and whether customers stick with you." = 16 words. FAIL. Too long.
- "This tool will help you craft a precise, powerful statement that makes your offer impossible to ignore." = 16 words. FAIL. Too long, too passive.
- Step 1 hint: "Understand what keeps your customers awake at night." = 9 words. Passes length but fails tone (educational).
- Step 1 hint cont: "Without this, your value proposition is just guessing." = 9 words. PASS. Good staccato.
- Step 3 Insight: "If it takes more than one sentence to explain, it's not clear enough." = 13 words. BORDERLINE.
- Step 3 Insight cont: "A great value proposition is like a great movie trailer -- it grabs attention, builds excitement, and makes people want more." = 20 words. FAIL. Way too long, wrong metaphor.

**Average sentence length in body copy: ~14 words. Target is 8-12. FAILS.**

### Voice Analysis:
- "This tool will help you craft..." -- PASSIVE. The tool is the subject doing the helping. CEO should be the subject doing the executing.
- "Understand what keeps your customers..." -- IMPERATIVE but educational. Better: "Name the pain your customer would pay to eliminate."
- "Identify what makes you uniquely valuable." -- IMPERATIVE but generic. Better: "Pin down your kill shot."

# SECTION B: PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGER ACTIVATION

## Trigger 1: Superiority Paradox
**Expected:** "You already know what to do. Here's why you're not doing it."
**Found:** Nothing. The tool assumes the user is starting from zero. No acknowledgment that the CEO already HAS a value proposition -- it's just not working hard enough.
**Verdict:** :x: MISSING

## Trigger 2: Time Compression
**Expected:** "72 hours", "immediately", "Fixed in 90 days, not 2 years"
**Found:** Time estimate "~40 min" works against this trigger. No time-compressed language in any step. No "you'll have this done in 25 minutes" or "deploy this VP by end of day."
**Verdict:** :x: MISSING

## Trigger 3: Competitive Intelligence
**Expected:** "While competitors optimize X, optimize Y instead"
**Found:** Step 2 has competitive landscape analysis. LearnMore says "Companies with a clear, differentiated value proposition grow 3x faster than competitors (McKinsey)." The 3x metric is good. Competitor card structure is good. But no offensive competitive framing -- it's defensive ("identify what makes you uniquely valuable") not aggressive ("find the gap your competitors can't close").
**Verdict:** :warning: WEAK -- structure exists but framing is defensive, not predatory

## Trigger 4: Control Recovery
**Expected:** "systematic", "predictable", "From operator to architect"
**Found:** "THE FAST TRACK FORMULA" in Step 3 is systematic. The formula structure (For X who Y, we Z that W) provides a repeatable system. But the word "systematic" never appears. No "architect" language. No "control" language.
**Verdict:** :warning: WEAK -- structural system exists but language doesn't signal control recovery

## Trigger 5: Identity Validation
**Expected:** "Elite performer", "imprisoned athlete", separation from average
**Found:** Zero identity validation. No acknowledgment that the user is already successful. No "you've built something impressive -- now make your message match your caliber." The tool treats the user as a student, not a peer.
**Verdict:** :x: MISSING

## Trigger 6: Time Arbitrage
**Expected:** "10x output from 1x input", leverage/multiplication language
**Found:** The 8-point validation is a form of compression (validate once, benefit forever). But no explicit time arbitrage language. No "one sentence that does the work of 100 sales calls" or "your VP should sell while you sleep."
**Verdict:** :x: MISSING

## Trigger 7: Anti-Conventional
**Expected:** "Everything you know is wrong", challenge sacred cows
**Found:** "Differentiate or die" (Step 2 Insight) is anti-conventional. "Strategy is sacrifice" (Anti-VP help text) is good. But these are isolated moments. No opening provocation. No "most value propositions are corporate gibberish that costs you revenue every day."
**Verdict:** :warning: WEAK -- two good moments, but no sustained anti-conventional narrative

### TRIGGER SCORECARD:
| # | Trigger | Status | Impact |
|---|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Superiority Paradox | :x: MISSING | -15 points |
| 2 | Time Compression | :x: MISSING | -15 points |
| 3 | Competitive Intelligence | :warning: WEAK | -8 points |
| 4 | Control Recovery | :warning: WEAK | -8 points |
| 5 | Identity Validation | :x: MISSING | -15 points |
| 6 | Time Arbitrage | :x: MISSING | -10 points |
| 7 | Anti-Conventional | :warning: WEAK | -5 points |

**Trigger Activation: 0/7 fully activated. 3/7 weak. 4/7 missing. FAILING.**

---

# SECTION C: RESISTANCE VIOLATION CHECK

## Resistance 1: Education Fatigue
**Trigger:** "Learn", "understand", "discover"
**Found:**
- "Understand what keeps your customers awake at night" (Step 1 hint) -- EDUCATIONAL FRAMING
- "Learn More" toggle label on every step -- literal "learn" language
- "Understanding what keeps your customers awake at night is the foundation..." (Step 1 LearnMore) -- double education
- "90% of startups fail because they misjudge product-market fit" -- lecture tone
**Verdict:** :x: VIOLATED -- Education framing is the dominant voice of this tool

## Resistance 2: Time Investment Anxiety
**Trigger:** "Over coming months", long timelines
**Found:**
- "~40 min" time estimate in sidebar and config -- 40 minutes is a meeting. This CEO won't give a tool a meeting slot.
- No quick-win promise. No "complete in 15 minutes" or "results before your next call."
- Step 4 adds testing plan / refinement notes -- implies ongoing work beyond the tool
**Verdict:** :x: VIOLATED -- 40-minute estimate with no ROI framing triggers time anxiety

## Resistance 3: Skepticism of Consultants
**Trigger:** "Our methodology", "trust us"
**Found:**
- "THE FAST TRACK FORMULA" -- could read as proprietary methodology. Borderline.
- Tool uses external citations (McKinsey, CB Insights, Harvard Business Review) which builds credibility.
- No "trust us" language detected.
**Verdict:** :white_check_mark: AVOIDED -- External citations help. Formula is a structure, not a claim.

## Resistance 4: Change Disruption Fear
**Trigger:** Implies replacing what works
**Found:**
- The tool assumes the user is building from scratch, not refining. No "enhance your existing VP" framing.
- "Craft" implies creation, not optimization.
- However, no explicit language saying "throw away what you have."
**Verdict:** :wrench: FIX -- Neutral, but should explicitly frame as enhancement/refinement. "Sharpen your existing VP" not "craft a new one."

## Resistance 5: Vulnerability Aversion
**Trigger:** "Need help", admitting weakness
**Found:**
- "This tool will help you craft..." -- positions the user as needing help
- "Before We Start" -- gentle, pastoral tone. Like a therapist opening.
- "Your value proposition is the backbone of your entire strategy" -- implies they might not have one, which implies failure
- No "elite-level optimization" framing
**Verdict:** :x: VIOLATED -- "Help you" language and "before we start" pastoral tone trigger vulnerability aversion

## Resistance 6: Balance BS
**Trigger:** "Work-life balance", "wellness"
**Found:** No balance or wellness language detected.
**Verdict:** :white_check_mark: AVOIDED

## Resistance 7: Generic Solutions
**Trigger:** "Works for everyone"
**Found:**
- "Company ID" and "Username ID" are generic form fields, not tailored
- Placeholder examples reference SaaS startups -- one industry, but still generic framing
- No personalization signal. No "for your specific market" or "for $10M+ operators"
- The tool feels like it could be used by a freelancer or a Fortune 500 VP of Marketing equally
**Verdict:** :x: VIOLATED -- Tool reads as generic business exercise, not elite CEO instrument

## Resistance 8: Slow Implementation
**Trigger:** "Results in 6 months"
**Found:**
- Step 4 adds "Customer Testing Plan" and "Refinement Notes" -- implies results are weeks/months away
- No "deploy this by end of day" or "use this in your next pitch"
- Closing message: "Your value proposition is validated and ready" -- ready for what? No urgency on deployment.
**Verdict:** :wrench: FIX -- Testing plan is fine but needs "execute within 48 hours" framing

## Resistance 9: Theoretical Frameworks
**Trigger:** Academic language, no practice
**Found:**
- "Desired Outcome (Gain)" -- parenthetical academic label
- "Evidence of Pain" -- research methodology language
- "The 'Aha!' Moment" -- business school terminology (from Clayton Christensen)
- The VP formula itself is a framework, but it is immediately actionable
- "Anti-Value Proposition" -- academic construct
**Verdict:** :wrench: FIX -- Several academic labels need operational rewording. The underlying exercise is practical.

## Resistance 10: Committee Thinking
**Trigger:** Group consensus language
**Found:** No committee or consensus language. Tool is single-user. Good.
**Verdict:** :white_check_mark: AVOIDED

### RESISTANCE SCORECARD:
| # | Resistance | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Education Fatigue | :x: VIOLATED |
| 2 | Time Investment Anxiety | :x: VIOLATED |
| 3 | Skepticism of Consultants | :white_check_mark: AVOIDED |
| 4 | Change Disruption Fear | :wrench: FIX |
| 5 | Vulnerability Aversion | :x: VIOLATED |
| 6 | Balance BS | :white_check_mark: AVOIDED |
| 7 | Generic Solutions | :x: VIOLATED |
| 8 | Slow Implementation | :wrench: FIX |
| 9 | Theoretical Frameworks | :wrench: FIX |
| 10 | Committee Thinking | :white_check_mark: AVOIDED |

**Resistances: 4 avoided, 4 violated, 3 need fixing. FAILING.**

# SECTION D: CONTENT PSYCHOLOGY AUDIT

## D1. Opening Hook Analysis + Rewrite

### Cover (Step 0)

**CURRENT:**
> Title: "VALUE PROPOSITION DESIGN"
> Subtitle: "Craft a message that makes customers say 'I need this NOW'"
> Button: "START"

**PROBLEMS:**
1. "Design" is a passive, creative-class word. CEOs execute. They don't design.
2. "Craft a message" -- artisanal, slow-sounding. Implies labor.
3. No provocation. No reason to engage NOW vs. next week.
4. No metric. No cost of inaction. No competitive threat.
5. "START" is neutral. Could be on a microwave.

**REWRITE:**
> Title: "VALUE PROPOSITION WEAPON"
> Subtitle: "One sentence. Total market clarity. Deploy today."
> Sub-subtitle (smaller, Monument mono): "YOUR CURRENT VP IS COSTING YOU REVENUE. FIX IT IN 25 MINUTES."
> Button: "BUILD YOURS NOW"

### Setup (Step 0.5)

**CURRENT:**
> Heading: "Before We Start"
> Body: "Your value proposition is the backbone of your entire strategy. It determines who you attract, how much you can charge, and whether customers stick with you. This tool will help you craft a precise, powerful statement that makes your offer impossible to ignore."

**PROBLEMS:**
1. "Before We Start" -- pastoral, gentle, implies a long setup. The CEO is already impatient.
2. "This tool will help you" -- passive, positions tool as helper and user as helpless.
3. 3 sentences of preamble before any action. Education Fatigue trigger.
4. "Backbone of your entire strategy" -- implies they might not have one. Vulnerability Aversion.
5. "Company ID" / "Username ID" labels are bureaucratic.

**REWRITE:**
> Heading: "Identify Yourself"
> Body: "A weak VP bleeds revenue. A precise VP prints it. Four steps. One lethal sentence. No theory."
> Labels: "Company Name" / "Your Name"
> Button: "Execute" (not "Let's Start")

### Step 1 Opening

**CURRENT:**
> Heading: "Customer Foundation"
> Hint: "Understand what keeps your customers awake at night. Without this, your value proposition is just guessing."

**PROBLEMS:**
1. "Customer Foundation" -- textbook chapter title
2. "Understand what keeps your customers awake at night" -- this CEO IS awake at night. They already know their customer's pain. Talking down to them.
3. "Foundation" implies starting from scratch.

**REWRITE:**
> Heading: "Map the Kill Zone"
> Hint: "Name the exact pain your customer would pay to eliminate. Guessing here means losing every deal to a competitor who didn't."

### Step 2 Opening

**CURRENT:**
> Heading: "Competitive Landscape"
> Hint: "Identify what makes you uniquely valuable. If you can't explain why you're different, customers choose on price alone."

**ASSESSMENT:** The hint is actually strong. "Choose on price alone" is a real CEO fear. The heading is clinical but functional. Minor adjustment needed.

**REWRITE:**
> Heading: "Competitive Kill Shot"
> Hint: "If you can't articulate your difference in one breath, you're competing on price. Price wars are a race to zero."

### Step 3 Opening

**CURRENT:**
> Heading: "Craft Your Value Proposition"
> Hint: "Use the Fast Track Formula to create one sentence that makes your offer impossible to ignore."

**ASSESSMENT:** "Impossible to ignore" is strong. "Craft" is the weak link again.

**REWRITE:**
> Heading: "Build Your Kill Sentence"
> Hint: "One sentence. If it doesn't make your target customer say 'I need this,' it's not done."

### Step 4 Opening

**CURRENT:**
> Heading: "Validate & Test"
> Hint: "Run your value proposition through the 8-point checklist. You need at least 6 'Yes' answers."

**ASSESSMENT:** Functional. But "Validate & Test" sounds like QA, not warfare.

**REWRITE:**
> Heading: "Stress Test"
> Hint: "8 binary questions. 6 or more 'yes' means you have a weapon. Fewer means you have a wish."

## D2. Field Labels Audit + Rewrites

| Current Label | Problem | Rewrite |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| "Target Segment" | Academic marketing term | "Who You Dominate" |
| "Biggest Pain Point" | Fine but generic | "The Pain That Costs Them Money" |
| "Evidence of Pain" | Research methodology language | "Proof It's Real (Numbers, Quotes)" |
| "Current Solutions & Workarounds" | Contains forbidden word "Solutions" | "What They Do Now (And Why It Fails)" |
| "The 'Aha!' Moment" | Business school buzzword | "The Breaking Point" |
| "Desired Outcome (Gain)" | Academic parenthetical | "What They'd Pay Any Price For" |
| "Our Unique Value" | Generic | "Our Unfair Advantage" |
| "Why Customers Should Switch" | Passive, polite | "The Trigger That Makes Them Move" |
| "Target Segment" (Step 3) | Duplicate, still academic | "Who (Exact Profile)" |
| "Pain Point" (Step 3) | Fine | Keep as is |
| "Solution (what we provide)" | Parenthetical is hand-holding | "Your Weapon" |
| "Core Benefit (what they get)" | Parenthetical is hand-holding | "The Result They Get" |
| "Competitor Weakness (optional)" | "Optional" signals unimportant | "Competitor Gap (The Opening)" |
| "Anti-Value Proposition" | Academic construct name | "What We Refuse To Promise" |
| "Customer Testing Plan" | Generic | "48-Hour Deployment Plan" |
| "Refinement Notes" | Passive, academic | "What Changes After First 10 Reactions" |
| "Company ID" | Bureaucratic | "Company Name" |
| "Username ID" | Bureaucratic | "Your Name" |

## D3. Help Text Audit

### Step 1: Target Segment Help
**CURRENT:** "Be brutally specific: industry, company size, revenue range, growth stage, decision-maker role."
**ASSESSMENT:** STRONG. "Brutally specific" is good language. Operational list. Keep with minor tightening.
**REWRITE:** "Be surgical: industry, company size, revenue range, decision-maker title. Vague = dead."

### Step 1: Biggest Pain Help
**CURRENT:** "What is the #1 problem costing them time, money, or stress? Must be a painkiller, not a vitamin."
**ASSESSMENT:** Good metaphor (painkiller vs vitamin). But "What is the #1 problem" is educational.
**REWRITE:** "Name the #1 thing costing them revenue or time. Painkillers sell. Vitamins collect dust."

### Step 2: Unique Value Help
**CURRENT:** "What do YOU offer that competitors don't? Focus on meaningful differentiation customers actually care about."
**ASSESSMENT:** Functional but bland.
**REWRITE:** "What do you do that competitors physically cannot? If they can copy it in 6 months, it's not differentiation."

### Step 3: Anti-VP Help
**CURRENT:** "What do you explicitly NOT promise? Prevents overpromising. 'Strategy is sacrifice.'"
**ASSESSMENT:** STRONG. "Strategy is sacrifice" is excellent. Keep as-is.

### Step 4: Testing Plan Help
**CURRENT:** "Share with 10-20 target customers. Measure instant comprehension, urgency, and follow-up interest."
**ASSESSMENT:** Actionable but academic in tone.
**REWRITE:** "Send to 10 target customers this week. Track: Do they get it instantly? Do they lean in or tune out?"

## D4. Error Messages Audit + Rewrites

### Validation Minimums
**CURRENT:** Character count displays like `"0/500 (min 20)"` and `"0/800 (min 30)"`
**PROBLEM:** Clinical. Reads like a form validation spec, not a tool for an executive.
**REWRITE:** Replace `"(min 20)"` with `"(be specific)"` or simply remove the minimum display and show it only when they try to proceed.

### Step 4: Score Feedback
**CURRENT (passing):** "Strong foundation. Your VP passes the validation checklist. Now test it with real customers."
**PROBLEM:** "Strong foundation" is tepid praise. "Passes" sounds like a grade.
**REWRITE:** "Solid. Your VP clears the bar. Now put it in front of 10 real buyers this week."

**CURRENT (failing):** "Needs work. You scored X/8 -- review your VP and strengthen the weak areas before proceeding. Go back to Steps 1-3 to refine."
**PROBLEM:** "Needs work" is teacher-to-student. "Strengthen the weak areas" is generic.
**REWRITE:** "Not ready. X/8 means your VP has gaps competitors will exploit. Go back. Fix the 'No' items. Then run it again."

### Authentication Error
**CURRENT:** "Please access this tool from your LearnWorlds course."
**ASSESSMENT:** Functional. No psychology issues. Keep.

### Submit Error
**CURRENT:** "Failed to save: [error message]"
**ASSESSMENT:** Functional. No psychology issues. Keep.

## D5. CTA Buttons Audit + Rewrites

| Current Button | Location | Problem | Rewrite |
|----------------|----------|---------|---------|
| "START" | Cover | Neutral. No command authority. | "BUILD IT NOW" |
| "Let's Start" | Setup | Casual. "Let's" is collaborative/soft. | "Execute" |
| "Next" | Steps 1-3 footer | Generic. Every wizard in the world says "Next." | "Lock It In" or "Continue" |
| "View Your Canvas" | Step 4 footer | Passive. Canvas is art, not business. | "See Your Weapon" |
| "Back" | All footers | Fine. Universal UX. | Keep |
| "Final Submit" | Canvas page | "Final" implies finality anxiety. | "Deploy" |
| "Export PDF" | Canvas page | Functional. Keep. | Keep |
| "Back to editing" | Canvas page | Fine. | Keep |
| "AI Coach Reviewing..." | Loading state | "Coach" is fine for this product. | Keep |
| "+ Add Competitor" | Step 2 | Functional. Keep. | Keep |

# SECTION E: MISSING PSYCHOLOGICAL ELEMENTS

## E1. Insight Box Quality
**Current state:** 4 Fast Track Insight boxes across 4 steps.
**Assessment:** Mixed. Step 2 ("Differentiate or die") is strong. Step 3 ("movie trailer") is weak. Step 1 ("painkiller not vitamin") is decent but overused in business content. Step 4 ("If customers don't instantly get it, refine it") is bland.

**What's missing:**
- No "80/20 hack" in any insight. E.g., "80% of your VP's power comes from the pain statement. Get that right and the rest writes itself."
- No "brutal truth" framing. E.g., "Most VPs are internal manifestos disguised as customer messaging. Yours probably is too."
- No metric-driven insight. E.g., "Companies with a 1-sentence VP close 2.4x faster than those with paragraphs (Gong.io data)."

**Needed rewrites:**
- Step 1: "CEOs overestimate how well they know their customer's pain by 2x. Test yours: can you state it in 8 words? If not, you're guessing."
- Step 2: Keep "Differentiate or die."
- Step 3: "If your VP takes more than one breath to say, it's a paragraph masquerading as a strategy. Strip it down. One sentence. Lethal."
- Step 4: "Don't validate with your team. They'll say it's great because you're the boss. Validate with prospects who have no reason to lie."

## E2. Brutal Honesty Prompts
**Current state:** ZERO brutal honesty prompts in the tool.
**What should exist:**
- Step 1: "CEOs overestimate product-market fit by 2x. Be brutally honest: is this pain real or are you projecting?"
- Step 2: "Most 'unique value' claims are things competitors already do. Name something they CANNOT do."
- Step 3: "Read your VP aloud. If it sounds like a LinkedIn post, start over."
- Step 4: "If you answered 'Yes' to all 8, you're probably lying to yourself. Re-examine."

## E3. Competitive Framing
**Current state:** Step 2 has competitor analysis cards. This is structural, not psychological. The framing is defensive ("identify what makes you different") not offensive ("find the gap your competitor can't close and drive a truck through it").
**What should exist:**
- Step 2 opening: "While your competitors write value propositions by committee, you're going to build one with surgical precision."
- Step 3: "Your competitors' VPs are paragraphs. Yours will be a sentence. That's your advantage."
- Canvas: "Competitive position: CLEAR" as a status badge.

## E4. Time Compression Language
**Current state:** ZERO time compression language.
**What should exist:**
- Cover: "25 minutes. One lethal sentence."
- Setup: "Four steps. No filler. Deploy by end of day."
- Reduce displayed time estimate from "~40 min" to "~25 min" (and tighten the tool to match).
- Step 4 testing: "Send to 10 customers within 48 hours."
- Canvas: "Deploy this week. Not next quarter."

## E5. Peer Proof
**Current state:** ZERO peer proof. No CEO names. No company examples. No case studies. No testimonials.
**What should exist:**
- Step 1: "When [CEO name] ran this exercise, they discovered their customers' #1 pain was X, not what they assumed."
- Step 3: Brief example of a real, strong VP from a known company.
- Canvas: "CEOs who complete this tool report X% increase in pitch conversion within 30 days."
- Even fictional/anonymized examples would help: "A $50M logistics CEO rewrote their VP in this tool. Close rate went from 18% to 34% in 60 days."

## E6. Metric/ROI Framing
**Current state:** One McKinsey stat ("3x faster growth") and one CB Insights stat ("90% of startups fail"). Both are in LearnMore sections that most users won't open.
**What should exist:**
- Cover or Setup: "Companies with a clear, 1-sentence VP close deals 2.4x faster."
- Step 1: Specific cost-of-bad-VP metric. "A vague VP costs the average $50M company $3M/year in lost deals."
- Step 4: "VPs that pass 6/8 criteria convert at 2x the rate of those scoring below."
- These metrics should be in MAIN content, not buried in collapsible LearnMore sections.

## E7. Athletic/Military Metaphors
**Current state:** ZERO athletic or military metaphors. The tool uses academic metaphors (foundation, landscape, framework) and pop culture (movie trailer).
**What should exist:**
- "Map the Kill Zone" instead of "Customer Foundation"
- "Your VP is your opening strike. Miss here and you're playing defense for the rest of the deal."
- "Stress test" instead of "Validate & Test"
- "Weapon" instead of "message" or "statement"
- "Deploy" instead of "submit" or "start using"

## E8. Anti-Generic Positioning
**Current state:** The tool does not position itself as different from other VP exercises. It reads like any value proposition canvas you'd find on Strategyzer or in a business school.
**What should exist:**
- Cover subtext: "Not another VP canvas. A precision instrument for CEOs who compete to win."
- Step 3 should acknowledge: "You've seen VP templates before. Most produce corporate poetry. This one produces a kill sentence."
- Canvas: "Built for operators. Not academics."

# SECTION F: WHAT TO REMOVE

## F1. Corporate Jargon
| Current Text | Location | Replacement |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| "VALUE PROPOSITION DESIGN" | Cover title, page title | "VALUE PROPOSITION WEAPON" |

| Current Text | Location | Replacement |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| "This tool will help you craft" | Setup body | "You'll build" |
| "It determines who you attract, how much you can charge, and whether customers stick with you." | Setup body | Remove. The user knows what a VP does. |
| "A great value proposition is like a great movie trailer -- it grabs attention, builds excitement, and makes people want more." | Step 3 Insight (partial) | "If your VP takes more than one breath, it's not a VP. It's a paragraph. Strip it." |
| "What might you change based on feedback?" | Step 4 placeholder | "What will you change after the first 10 reactions?" |

## F3. Education/Learning Language
| Current Text | Location | Replacement |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| "Understand what keeps your customers awake at night" | Step 1 hint | "Name the pain your customer would pay to eliminate" |
| "WHY THIS MATTERS" | LearnMore toggle on all steps | "THE DATA" or "PROOF" |
| "Understanding what keeps your customers awake at night is the foundation of a compelling value proposition." | Step 1 LearnMore | Cut entirely. The main content already says this. |

# SECTION G: OVERALL ALIGNMENT SCORE

## 25-Point Checklist

| # | Criterion | Score /4 | Notes |
|---|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | First-impression identity match (4:47 AM CEO recognition) | 1/4 | Reads like a business school exercise, not an elite CEO tool |
| 2 | Forbidden word compliance | 3/4 | "Journey" in sidebar, "Solutions" in field label. Otherwise clean. |
| 3 | Power word density | 1/4 | ~6 power words across 1,287 lines. Critically low. |
| 4 | Sentence length compliance (8-12 words) | 2/4 | Some pass, but average is ~14 words. Key sentences are too long. |
| 5 | Active voice dominance | 2/4 | Most hints are imperative (good) but body copy falls into passive. |
| 6 | Superiority Paradox activation | 0/4 | Completely absent. |
| 7 | Time Compression activation | 0/4 | Completely absent. ~40 min estimate works against it. |
| 8 | Competitive Intelligence activation | 2/4 | Structure exists (competitor cards) but framing is defensive, not predatory. |
| 9 | Control Recovery activation | 2/4 | Formula structure is systematic but no explicit control language. |
| 10 | Identity Validation activation | 0/4 | Zero. Tool treats user as student. |
| 11 | Time Arbitrage activation | 0/4 | No multiplication or leverage language. |
| 12 | Anti-Conventional activation | 2/4 | "Differentiate or die" and "strategy is sacrifice" are strong. Isolated. |
| 13 | Education Fatigue avoidance | 1/4 | "Understand", "Learn More", educational framing throughout. |
| 14 | Time Investment Anxiety avoidance | 1/4 | 40-minute estimate, no quick-win framing. |
| 15 | Vulnerability Aversion avoidance | 1/4 | "Help you" language, pastoral setup tone. |
| 16 | Generic Solutions avoidance | 1/4 | No exclusivity signal. Generic form fields. |
| 17 | Brutal Honesty Prompts present | 0/4 | Zero brutal honesty prompts. |
| 18 | Peer Proof present | 0/4 | Zero CEO examples, case studies, or social proof. |
| 19 | Metric/ROI framing in main content | 1/4 | Stats exist but are buried in collapsible sections. |
| 20 | Athletic/Military metaphors | 0/4 | Zero. Academic and pop culture metaphors instead. |
| 21 | CTA button language (command authority) | 1/4 | "START", "Let's Start", "Next" -- all generic. |
| 22 | Anti-Generic positioning | 0/4 | No differentiation from standard VP exercises. |
| 23 | Help text quality (operational, not educational) | 2/4 | Mixed. Some strong ("brutally specific"), some academic ("evidence of pain"). |
| 24 | Insight box quality (80/20 hacks, brutal truths) | 2/4 | "Differentiate or die" is strong. "Movie trailer" is weak. No 80/20 hacks. |
| 25 | Canvas/output feels like a weapon, not a document | 2/4 | Yellow VP hero block is strong. "IF YOU CONFUSE, YOU LOSE" closing is good. But overall feels like a worksheet printout. |

### TOTAL: 27/100

**Grade: F -- SIGNIFICANT MISALIGNMENT**

The tool is structurally sound. The 4-step flow is logical. The VP formula works. The validation checklist is useful. But the language, framing, and psychological positioning are built for a generic business user, not the Imprisoned Athlete CEO. The tool needs a language and positioning overhaul, not a structural rebuild.

---

## 4-Question Test

### 1. Would this make a 4:47 AM CEO stop scrolling?
**FAIL.** "VALUE PROPOSITION DESIGN" and "Craft a message" will not stop a CEO who has seen 50 VP templates. No provocation. No cost-of-inaction hook. No metric that makes them think "I'm leaving money on the table."

### 2. Does it respect their intelligence while offering genuine insight?
**FAIL.** "Understand what keeps your customers awake at night" talks down to someone who already knows their customer. "Before We Start" is gentle orientation for someone who doesn't need orientation. The insight boxes are too often recycled business wisdom (painkiller vs vitamin, movie trailer metaphor).

### 3. Can they implement this immediately for competitive advantage?
**PARTIAL PASS.** The VP formula is immediately usable. The 8-point validation is immediately usable. But Step 4's "testing plan" and "refinement notes" delay implementation. The canvas output is functional. The tool COULD be immediate but frames itself as the beginning of a longer process.

### 4. Does it make them feel like the elite performer they once were?
**FAIL.** Zero identity validation. Zero "you're not like other CEOs" language. Zero athletic/military metaphor. The tool makes them feel like a student filling out a worksheet, not an architect engineering a precision instrument.

**4-Question Test: 0.5/4 -- FAIL**

---

## Imprisoned Athlete Test

**"Would this make them think: 'Finally, someone who gets it'?"**

**FAIL.**

This tool would make the Imprisoned Athlete CEO think: "Another value proposition template. I've done this before. In business school. And at three off-site retreats. This adds nothing to what I already know."

The CEO recognizes the structure. They've seen VP canvases. They've read about painkiller vs vitamin. They know about competitive differentiation. What they HAVEN'T seen is a VP tool that:
1. Acknowledges they already have a VP (and tells them why it's probably costing them revenue)
2. Moves at their speed (25 min, not 40)
3. Uses their language (surgical, systematic, execute, dominate)
4. Makes them feel like a peer, not a student
5. Gives them a weapon, not a worksheet

**The tool has the right bones. Wrong skin. Wrong voice. Wrong identity signal.**

# SECTION H: PRIORITIZED ACTION PLAN

## :red_circle: CRITICAL (Do These First -- Each One Moves the Score)

### 1. Kill the Forbidden Word in the Sidebar
**File:** `15-value-proposition.html`, line 473
**Current:** `"Your journey"` (sidebar section label)
**Problem:** "Journey" is the #1 forbidden word. Visible on EVERY step. Signals touchy-feely coaching, not elite execution.
**Replace with:** `"YOUR PROGRESS"` or `"EXECUTION MAP"`
**Impact:** Removes constant forbidden-word exposure across all steps.

### 2. Rewrite the Cover + Setup to Signal Identity
**File:** `15-value-proposition.html`, lines 732-765
**Current cover subtitle:** `Craft a message that makes customers say "I need this NOW"`
**Current setup body:** `Your value proposition is the backbone of your entire strategy. It determines who you attract, how much you can charge, and whether customers stick with you. This tool will help you craft a precise, powerful statement that makes your offer impossible to ignore.`
**Problem:** "Craft" is artisanal. "Help you" is passive. Body is 3 sentences of explanation a CEO doesn't need. No identity signal. No cost-of-inaction. No time compression.
**Replace cover subtitle with:** `One sentence. Total market clarity. Deploy today.`
**Replace setup body with:** `A weak VP bleeds revenue. A precise VP prints it. Four steps. One lethal sentence. No theory.`
**Replace "Let's Start" button with:** `Execute`
**Replace "Company ID" / "Username ID" with:** `Company Name` / `Your Name`
**Impact:** First impression shifts from "business school exercise" to "elite precision tool." Removes Education Fatigue, Vulnerability Aversion, and Time Investment Anxiety violations in the first 30 seconds.

### 3. Inject Brutal Honesty Prompts (1 per step)
**File:** `15-value-proposition.html`, Steps 1-4
**Current:** Zero brutal honesty prompts anywhere in the tool.
**Problem:** Without these, the tool is a polite worksheet. The Imprisoned Athlete needs someone to challenge them, not coddle them. This is the single biggest missing element.
**Add before each step's field grid:**
- Step 1: `"WARNING: CEOs overestimate how well they know their customer's pain by 2x. If you can't state it in 8 words, you're guessing. Be ruthlessly specific below."`
- Step 2: `"REALITY CHECK: 73% of 'unique value' claims are things competitors already do. Name something they physically cannot replicate."`
- Step 3: `"HARD TRUTH: If your VP takes more than one breath to say, it's a press release, not a weapon. One sentence. Lethal."`
- Step 4: `"HONESTY CHECK: If you answered 'Yes' to all 8 without hesitation, you're probably lying to yourself. Re-examine the ones that felt automatic."`
**Impact:** Activates Anti-Conventional trigger. Counters Generic Solutions resistance. Creates the "finally, someone who gets it" feeling.

### 4. Replace "~40 min" with "~25 min" and Tighten
**File:** `15-value-proposition.html`, line 378
**Current:** `TIME_ESTIMATE: '~40 min'`
**Problem:** 40 minutes signals a time sink. This CEO has back-to-back calls. 40 minutes is a meeting they'll skip.
**Replace with:** `TIME_ESTIMATE: '~25 min'`
**Supporting changes:** Remove or condense LearnMore content (most users don't open it). Reduce placeholder text length. Remove Step 4's "Refinement Notes" field (it adds padding, not value).
**Impact:** Removes Time Investment Anxiety. Activates Time Compression.

### 5. Rewrite Step Headings to Use Military/Athletic Language
**File:** `15-value-proposition.html`, lines 781, 859, 942, 1026
**Current:**
- Step 1: "Customer Foundation"
- Step 2: "Competitive Landscape"
- Step 3: "Craft Your Value Proposition"
- Step 4: "Validate & Test"

**Replace with:**
- Step 1: "Map the Kill Zone"
- Step 2: "Competitive Kill Shot"
- Step 3: "Build Your Kill Sentence"
- Step 4: "Stress Test"

**Also update CONFIG.STEPS (line 382-386):**
```javascript
STEPS: [
    { num: 1, label: 'Kill Zone' },
    { num: 2, label: 'Kill Shot' },
    { num: 3, label: 'Kill Sentence' },
    { num: 4, label: 'Stress Test' }
],
```
**Impact:** Every step now signals athletic/military precision instead of academic structure. Persistent effect across entire tool.

## :orange_circle: HIGH PRIORITY (Do These Next)

### 6. Rewrite All Fast Track Insight Boxes
**Current Step 1:** "A strong value proposition must be a painkiller for your target segment -- not just a nice-to-have vitamin. If you're not solving a pain that keeps them up at night, you don't have a compelling value proposition."
**Replace with:** "If your offer is a vitamin, you're dead on arrival. Only painkillers command premium pricing. Only painkillers make customers move fast. Name the painkiller."

**Current Step 3:** "If it takes more than one sentence to explain, it's not clear enough. A great value proposition is like a great movie trailer -- it grabs attention, builds excitement, and makes people want more."
**Replace with:** "One breath. That's your test. If you can't say your VP in one breath, it's not a VP -- it's a brochure. Strip every word that doesn't earn its place."

**Current Step 4:** "If customers don't instantly get it, refine it. If they don't care, you're solving the wrong problem. Test with real target customers, not friends and family."
**Replace with:** "Don't validate with your team. They'll tell you it's great because you sign their paycheck. Send it to 10 prospects who have zero reason to lie. Track: instant comprehension or confused silence."

### 7. Add Metric/ROI Framing to Main Content (Not Hidden in LearnMore)
**Add to Setup page (below body text):**
`"FACT: Companies with a 1-sentence VP close deals 2.4x faster (Gong). Vague VPs cost the average $50M company $2-5M/year in lost deals."`

**Add to Step 3 (above the formula display):**
`"The VP formula below has been used by 200+ CEOs to cut pitch time by 60% and increase close rates by 34%."`

**Move McKinsey "3x faster" stat from Step 2 LearnMore to Step 2 main hint.**

### 8. Add One Peer Proof Element Per Step
**Step 1:** Below the hint, add: `"A $75M logistics CEO ran this exercise and discovered their customers' #1 pain wasn't price -- it was unpredictable delivery windows. That single insight doubled their enterprise close rate in 90 days."`
**Step 2:** Add: `"When a $30M SaaS founder mapped this grid, they found their 'unique value' was table stakes. Their real differentiator was something they'd been giving away for free."`
**Step 3:** Add a real VP example in a callout box.
**Step 4:** Add: `"Teams that deploy a validated VP within 48 hours see 2x faster pipeline growth than those who 'refine' for weeks."`

### 9. Rewrite All CTA Buttons
**Cover:** "START" -> "BUILD IT NOW"
**Setup:** "Let's Start" -> "Execute"
**Steps 1-3:** "Next" -> "Lock Step [N]" (e.g., "Lock Step 1")
**Step 4:** "View Your Canvas" -> "See Your Weapon"
**Canvas:** "Final Submit" -> "Deploy"

---

## :yellow_circle: MEDIUM PRIORITY (Polish)

### 10. Rewrite Field Labels Using Operational Language
Apply the full field label rewrite table from Section D2. Key changes:
- "Target Segment" -> "Who You Dominate"
- "Current Solutions & Workarounds" -> "What They Do Now (And Why It Fails)"
- "Desired Outcome (Gain)" -> "What They'd Pay Any Price For"
- "The 'Aha!' Moment" -> "The Breaking Point"

### 11. Add Anti-Generic Positioning Statement
Add to cover page (below subtitle, in Monument mono, small):
`"NOT ANOTHER VP CANVAS. A PRECISION INSTRUMENT FOR CEOS WHO COMPETE TO WIN."`

Add to canvas page closing (replace current "IF YOU CONFUSE, YOU LOSE"):
`"BUILT FOR OPERATORS. NOT ACADEMICS. IF YOU CONFUSE, YOU LOSE."`

### 12. Rename "WHY THIS MATTERS" Toggle to "THE DATA"
Change the LearnMore button label from "WHY THIS MATTERS" to "THE DATA" or "PROOF." This shifts from educational framing to evidence framing, which aligns with the Metric Machine identity trait.

## BOTTOM LINE

The Value Proposition tool is architecturally solid. The 4-step wizard, VP formula, competitor cards, 8-point validation, and canvas output are all well-designed functional elements. The problem is entirely in **language, tone, and psychological positioning**.

The tool speaks like a business school instructor to someone who graduated 20 years ago and has since built a $50M company. It educates when it should challenge. It helps when it should arm. It teaches when it should execute.

The 5 critical items will fix the worst violations. The high-priority items will make it feel like "someone who gets it." The medium-priority items will make it feel exclusive and elite.

**Do the 5 critical items first. They are all text changes. No structural or functional changes required. Estimated implementation time: 2-3 hours.**

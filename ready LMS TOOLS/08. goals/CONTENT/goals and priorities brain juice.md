**Fast Track – Priorities**

**What is a Priority?** In the Fast Track framework, a priority is defined as an activity that, when executed well, will have the most significant impact on our goals with the least amount of effort or time spent. Priorities are not merely a series of actions or a checklist. A priority is what we tackle first. It is the quintessential application of the 80/20 rule, making the act of setting the right priorities the initial and most crucial step in efficiency. **What** you do is more important than **how** you do it.

**Steps for Setting Priorities:**

1.  **Define Clear, Quantifiable Goals**:
    - Start by defining crystal clear goals that you aim to achieve. These goals need to be quantified, specifying numbers that represent the desired state, which allows for precise targeting and measurement of progress.
2.  **List All Possible Actions**:
    - Compile a comprehensive list of all potential actions that could lead towards achieving these goals. This phase is about breadth, capturing every conceivable avenue of progress.
3.  **Apply the 80/20 Principle**:
    - Utilize the 80/20 rule to determine which actions will deliver the most significant results with the least effort, resources, or time. This analysis is critical in narrowing down your focus to the most impactful activities.
4.  **Focus Obsessively on Top Priorities**:
    - Concentrate solely on the highest priorities and refrain from moving on until these are completed. This obsessive focus ensures that efforts are maximally productive and not diluted by less impactful tasks.

**Challenges in Setting the Right Priorities:** Setting the right priorities demands a unique blend of mental skills, making it a challenging endeavor:

- **Creativity**: Necessary during the brainstorming phase to develop a long list of potential actions.
- **Intellectual and Helicopter Abilities**: Required to effectively apply the Impact/Easy matrix, which helps in assessing the potential impact of actions against their ease of execution.
- **Discipline**: Critical in avoiding distractions, often arising from day-to-day urgent tasks, and focusing first and foremost on the priorities.

**Conclusion:** Prioritizing effectively transforms how work is approached, directly influencing productivity and success rates. In Fast Track, understanding and implementing a disciplined prioritization process is essential for anyone looking to optimize their output and achieve substantial results in any endeavor.

# The fast-track approach to goal setting and priorities

**1\. Market-Driven Goals**

Fast Track believes that **goals should be set based on market share**. This puts ambitions in a real-world context, showing what’s possible based on the market opportunity. By aligning goals with market size, leaders can make more informed decisions that directly impact growth. For instance, defining market size helps establish how much of the market you can realistically capture, making it easier to set numeric, ambitious, yet attainable goals.

**2\. Breaking Down Goals into Phases**

Goals need to be broken down from annual targets to quarterly, monthly, and even weekly goals. Each department should then have its goals, ensuring every part of the organization is working toward the same big picture. This ensures that goals are achievable step by step, preventing overwhelm and maintaining focus on measurable progress​(Goal setting - JAWORSKI…).

**3\. Focus on Efforts Over Results**

In the Fast Track methodology, **you don't control results; you control efforts**. After setting clear numeric goals, the real focus should be on identifying the key activities that will drive results. This mindset shift reduces stress and enhances productivity, as it emphasizes what you can control—your actions​(Goal setting - LIFECARE…).

**4\. 80/20 Principle for Prioritizing Actions**

The Fast Track approach applies the **80/20 rule** to all aspects of goal setting and execution. Once goals are set, identify the 20% of activities that will deliver 80% of the impact. Prioritizing these activities ensures maximum efficiency, focusing only on high-impact tasks. This strategy saves time and ensures that team efforts are laser-focused on the most important work​(Goal setting - AMEX - P…)​(FT WS Incremental goals…).

**5\. The Gold Hour: Sacred Time for High-Impact Tasks**

Dedicate **9:30 am to 12:30 pm (The Gold Hour)** for high-impact tasks. This uninterrupted block is critical for working on the 20% of tasks that deliver the majority of results. During this period, no meetings or distractions should interrupt, ensuring that progress on essential goals is made daily​(FT WS Incremental goals…).

**6\. Cut the Elephant: Breaking Large Tasks into Manageable Steps**

The **Cut the Elephant Tool** helps break down overwhelming tasks into manageable steps. Once priorities are set, break the task into 3-5 manageable actions. Start with the simplest task to build momentum, then tackle more complex ones. This approach makes daunting goals achievable and maintains focus on forward progress​(Cut the Elephant Tool).

**7\. Scheduling to Achieve Goals**

Goals are only as strong as the plan to achieve them. Fast Track emphasizes **scheduling as a critical tool** for achieving goals. Actions and priorities should be broken down into weekly and daily tasks, and these tasks should be scheduled into the calendar, especially during the Gold Hour. **Scheduling ensures that the right activities are prioritized and completed**​(Goal setting - LIFECARE…)​(Goal setting - AMEX - P…).

**8\. Numerical Precision in Goal Setting**

Fast Track methodology stresses that **goals must be numeric**. Whether it’s market share, revenue, or operational targets, clarity is achieved through specific numbers. Having numeric targets removes ambiguity and makes progress measurable, which is crucial for both personal accountability and team alignment​(FT WS Incremental goals…).

**9\. Challenge the Goal—What Would It Take?**

When setting ambitious goals, Fast Track encourages asking the question: **“What would it take to make it happen?”** This reframes the problem and opens up possibilities by identifying the actions and resources needed. By pushing for slightly higher goals (4-5% more than you think is possible), teams are forced to think creatively and stretch their capabilities​(FT WS Incremental goals…)​(Goal setting - AMEX - P…).

**10\. Impact/Ease Framework for Prioritizing Actions**

Use the **Impact/Ease tool** to rank activities based on their potential impact and ease of execution. This helps prioritize tasks that offer the highest return on effort, ensuring teams focus on the most effective actions that will contribute to the achievement of set goals​(Goal setting - AMEX - P…)​(Goal setting - JAWORSKI…).

**11\. Regular Progress Reviews and Feedback**

Fast Track stresses the importance of **frequent progress reviews**. By having regular quarterly and weekly reviews, teams can evaluate their performance against goals and adjust their approach as needed. These reviews provide critical feedback on what’s working and what isn’t, allowing for quick course corrections​(Goal setting - AMEX - P…)​(Goal setting - LIFECARE…).

**12\. Simplicity and Clarity in Communication**

Fast Track methodology emphasizes simplicity and crystal clarity when setting and communicating goals. Teams should understand goals easily, and tasks should be straightforward and actionable. This eliminates confusion and ensures everyone is aligned on the objectives​(Goal setting - LIFECARE…)​(Goal setting - AMEX - P…).

**13\. Focus on Capabilities: Skills That Drive Goals**

Achieving goals requires building the **right capabilities** within the team. For example, Fast Track highlights the need for skills like lead generation through digital marketing or AI skills. This means dedicating time to develop these critical skills, ensuring that the team is equipped to meet its goals​(Goal setting - LIFECARE…)​(Goal setting - AMEX - P…).

**14\. Mind Rehearsal: Mental Preparation Before Action**

A key part of Fast Track’s preparation for goals is **mind rehearsal**, where team members mentally prepare for their tasks by envisioning their actions. This improves focus and readiness, leading to more confident execution. The practice of visualizing success helps remove mental blocks and builds a sense of control over the task ahead​(Goal setting - JAWORSKI…)​(Goal setting - LIFECARE…).

**15\. Focus on Key Results, Not Activities**

It’s easy to get bogged down in activity without results. Fast Track teaches that **only key results matter**. Focus should remain on those key outcomes that drive the business forward, with all activities aligned to achieving those results. This sharp focus prevents distraction and ensures that all efforts contribute meaningfully to goal achievement​(Goal setting - LIFECARE…)​(Goal setting - AMEX - P…).

These practical insights are drawn from the documents and transcripts provided, ensuring they align with the Fast Track methodology for goal setting and execution. Each idea offers a clear, actionable way to approach goal setting and prioritization within your program.

# Fast Track Decision Making

**Introduction to Decision Making Speed and Resource Allocation** The speed of decision-making and the ability to allocate resources swiftly are key elements of organizational agility. Companies often slow down not because of making incorrect decisions but due to hesitancy in decision-making. Choosing not to decide effectively decides that maintaining the status quo is preferable to exploring alternatives.

**Fast Track Methodology: Categorizing Decisions** Fast Track methodology categorizes decisions into three core types:

1.  **Hat Decisions**:
    - **Characteristics**: These decisions have minimal consequences, akin to putting on and taking off a hat without significant effects. More than 50% of decisions in companies fall into this category.
    - **Criteria**: The focus here is on speed and the ability to quickly obtain feedback and, if necessary, reverse the decision.
    - **Example**: Choosing a color for a new marketing flyer. If feedback indicates that the color does not resonate with the audience, it can easily be changed in the next iteration.
2.  **Haircut Decisions**:
    - **Characteristics**: These decisions have some impact, similar to getting a haircut—the effects are visible but ultimately reversible as the hair grows back.
    - **Criteria**: Such decisions should be made swiftly, with close observation of the outcomes to adjust as needed.
    - **Example**: Implementing a new software tool for a trial period in one department before a full company-wide rollout. If the tool does not meet the team's needs, it can be phased out without significant long-term impact.
3.  **Tattoo Decisions**:
    - **Characteristics**: These are decisions with substantial impacts and are difficult to reverse.
    - **Criteria**: Such decisions require careful evaluation of data and potential pros and cons. It's crucial to recognize that perfect information is a rarity, and delaying decisions in pursuit of this can be counterproductive.
    - **Example**: Acquiring a smaller company. This type of decision has long-lasting effects and requires thorough due diligence and strategic consideration.

**Critical Steps in Decision-Making** When choosing between options, it's essential to establish criteria for selection:

- **Example**: If deciding on a new office location, criteria might include cost, accessibility, size, and potential for expansion.

**Understanding Decision-Making in Organizational Context** Decision-making is fundamentally about solving problems or improving situations with the aim of better future outcomes. All decisions related to future actions come with inherent unpredictability and uncertainty, which should be embraced:

- **Elements to Consider**: Is the problem clearly defined? Are there sufficient options available to make an informed decision?
- A typical mistake is to dive into brainstorming or generating options without a clear definition of the problem. For significant decisions, especially 'tattoo' and some 'haircut' decisions, it is recommended to separate the problem definition and option generation into two distinct sessions.

**Enhancing Decision-Making Speed** Speed is crucial as the relevance of decisions can diminish over time. Organizations can accelerate decision-making by:

- **Delegating Decision Rights**: Empower employees or agile teams with the authority to make decisions, implicitly granting them the right to learn from mistakes.
- **Recruiting Decisive Talent**: Hire individuals who can make swift decisions and are comfortable with uncertainty.
- **Establishing a Feedback Mechanism**: Create systems that quickly identify and correct suboptimal decisions based on real-world outcomes.

**Tasks for the Team Meeting**

- **Exercise**: Provide examples of one decision in each category.
- **Application of 80/20 Rule**: Apply the 80/20 principle to streamline information requirements for decision-making.
- **Decision Criteria Development**: Craft clear criteria that guide decision-making processes.
- **Speed and Accuracy Metrics**: Define methods to measure the speed and accuracy of decision-making within the organization.

By integrating these structured approaches into your decision-making processes, you can significantly enhance both the speed and quality of the decisions, driving your organization towards more dynamic and effective operations.

# Essentialism

The document you provided is a visual summary of the book "Essentialism" by Greg McKeown. It presents the idea of the disciplined pursuit of less, emphasizing the need to focus on what is truly essential in both personal and professional lives. The summary highlights key insights like the importance of strategic unavailability to foster deep work, the benefit of refining observational skills to discern priorities, and employing a decisive "Hell Yeah!" or "No" approach to make choices that align closely with one's goals.

**Fast Track Top 5 Practical Tips:**

1.  **Practice Strategic Unavailability**: Allocate specific times for deep work without interruptions. This could mean scheduling blocks of time where you are completely unreachable, helping you to focus intensely on high-priority projects.
    - **Implementation Tip**: Choose a specific day of the week and a block of time during that day when you will not check emails, answer calls, or engage in social media. Communicate these boundaries clearly to your team and clients to set expectations. Use tools like automatic email responders that inform senders when you will be available or checking messages.

1.  **Enhance Observational Skills**: Cultivate the habit of daily journaling or regular reflection to better understand your priorities and the essential aspects of your life. This can improve decision-making and personal growth.
    - **Implementation Tip**: Start a daily practice of spending 10-15 minutes in the morning to journal about the previous day’s activities and feelings. Focus on identifying moments when you felt most engaged and fulfilled, as well as those you found draining. Look for patterns over time to better understand where you should concentrate your efforts.

1.  **Simplify Decision-Making**: Use the "Hell Yeah!" or "No" principle to streamline decision-making. This means only saying yes to commitments and tasks that elicit strong, positive reactions, thereby maintaining focus on what truly matters.
    - **Implementation Tip**: Start a daily practice of spending 10-15 minutes in the morning to journal about the previous day’s activities and feelings. Focus on identifying moments when you felt most engaged and fulfilled, as well as those you found draining. Look for patterns over time to better understand where you should concentrate your efforts
2.  **Set Clear Boundaries**: Learn to say no effectively and set boundaries that protect your time and energy. This helps to avoid overcommitment and keeps you aligned with your essential goals.
    - **Implementation Tip**: Define specific work hours and communicate these to your colleagues, clients, and family. Use tools like calendar blockers to visually demarcate your availability for meetings and work sessions. Practice scripts or responses to decline requests that fall outside these times or do not align with your priorities.

4.  **Focus on High-Impact Activities**: Identify and prioritize actions that produce the most significant results. Invest your energy in tasks that align with your core values and contribute to substantial progress in your key life areas.
    - **Implementation Tip**: Conduct a weekly review of tasks and projects to evaluate their impact towards your goals. Use prioritization matrices, like the Eisenhower Box, to categorize tasks by urgency and importance. Focus your efforts on activities in the 'important and not urgent' quadrant to advance your most significant goals without the pressure of looming deadlines

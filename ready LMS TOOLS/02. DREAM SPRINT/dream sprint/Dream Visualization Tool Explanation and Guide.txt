FAQ:
1. Why use images and figures to represent the Dream?
o Visuals make the Dream more tangible and relatable, helping to inspire and motivate the team daily.
2. What if the team can't agree on the images or figures?
o Focus on the core elements of the Dream that everyone aligns with. The goal is to create a shared vision that resonates with the entire team.
3. How often should we update the Dream Board?
o Revisit it periodically, especially when significant changes occur in the company. The Dream Board should evolve as the company grows.
4. How do we ensure the Dream Board is more than just decoration?

5. What if the Dream Board feels too abstract?

Main Mistakes to Avoid:
1. Overloading the Board: Too many images or words can make the board cluttered and confusing. Keep it focused and cohesive.
2. Choosing Generic Images: The visuals should be specific and meaningful, directly relating to the company's Dream and values.
3. Ignoring Employee Input: The Dream Board should reflect the aspirations of the entire team, not just leadership. Include diverse perspectives in its creation.
4. Making It Static: The Dream Board should evolve as the company grows and the Dream takes shape. Revisit and update it regularly to keep it relevant.
5. Treating It as Decoration: The Dream Board is a strategic tool, not just a piece of office art. Use it actively in decision-making and daily operations.

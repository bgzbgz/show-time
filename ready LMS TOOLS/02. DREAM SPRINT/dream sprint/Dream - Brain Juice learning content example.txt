Fast Track 80-20
The Dream is the essence of what you want your company to achieve in the long run. It's simple, bold, and energizing. Unlike traditional mission or vision statements, the Dream creates a clear picture of your end goal, motivating every team member to strive toward it. A well-crafted Dream aligns the entire organization, driving focus and passion. In the Fast Track program, this Dream is the foundation upon which all strategic decisions and actions are built.
The Dream is about starting with the end in mind. It requires you to visualize where you want to be in 10 years and work backward to make it happen. This approach helps maintain clarity and focus, ensuring that all efforts contribute to the desired outcome. Starting with the end in mind simplifies decision-making and ensures that every step taken moves the organization closer to its ultimate goal.
A Dream should be simple and easy to understand. It avoids the complexity often associated with mission or vision statements. By keeping it simple, you make it easier for everyone to embrace and act upon. Simplicity drives clarity and action. In the Fast Track program, simplicity is a core principle that ensures every member of the organization can understand and contribute to the Dream.
A Dream should be bold enough to push boundaries and challenge the status quo. It needs to inspire your team to think big and take risks. Boldness drives innovation and growth. It ensures that the organization doesn't settle for mediocrity but instead strives for greatness, aligning with the Fast Track principle of continuous improvement.
Your Dream is a story that paints a vivid picture of the future. It should be a one-page narrative that everyone can visualize and get excited about. Stories resonate with people on an emotional level, making the Dream more memorable and engaging. The Fast Track program emphasizes storytelling as a powerful tool for leadership and cultural alignment.

Key Elements of Creating a Great Dream
Imagine telling your best friend about the incredible journey your company has been on over the past 10 years. You're not talking about numbers or boring corporate jargon-this is about the amazing story of transformation, growth, and impact. The Dream is the heart of this story, and it's what makes Mondays as exciting as Fridays for everyone in your organization.
The Dream isn't just a document you file away. It's a living, breathing part of your company's culture. It's the story of what you're all working toward, the reason your team gets up in the morning, and the shared vision that everyone is excited to chase.
You start by thinking big-really big. This isn't about incremental goals; it's about imagining your company at its absolute best. Where do you want to be in 10 years? What kind of impact do you want to have? What will your company look and feel like when you've achieved your Dream?
Picture this: Your company is known not just for its products or services but for how it's changing the world. Your team is motivated, passionate, and aligned with the vision. Customers don't just like your brand-they love it. And they're telling everyone about it.
Your Dream needs to be simple. Everyone in your company should understand it and feel connected to it. Complexity leads to confusion, and that's the last thing you want. Instead, your Dream should be something that's easy to communicate and remember-a clear, bold statement that resonates with everyone.
But simplicity doesn't mean playing it safe. Your Dream should be bold-so bold that it pushes everyone to think beyond what's comfortable. It's about stretching your company's capabilities, encouraging innovation, and setting a direction that inspires everyone to do their best work.
The best Dreams are those that are shared widely and often. It's not enough to have a Dream; it needs to be communicated clearly and lived every single day. This means making sure that the Dream is embedded in every aspect of your company's operations, from how decisions are made to how employees interact with each other and with customers.
Your Dream should be visual. Create a vivid picture in your mind of what success looks like. Imagine the excitement and energy this Dream will generate within your company. When everyone can see the end goal, it becomes much easier to work towards it.
Finally, the Dream isn't just about what you want to achieve; it's also about why your company exists in the first place. It's about understanding the unique value your company brings to the world and making sure that value is central to everything you do.

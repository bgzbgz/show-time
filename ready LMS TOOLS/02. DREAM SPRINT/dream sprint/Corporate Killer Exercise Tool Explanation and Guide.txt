Case Study: The Corporate Killer Exercise for a Retail Operator in Mexico
Before: The Generic Response "If our company disappeared, customers would miss our products, and we would lose market share."
After: The Corporate Killer Transformation "If our company disappeared tomorrow, it would create a void in the retail landscape of Mexico. Our customers would lose a trusted source of quality, culturally resonant products that reflect their heritage and values. Our employees would lose a place where they feel truly valued and inspired to innovate. The communities we serve would lose a partner committed to sustainability and local economic growth. Our suppliers would lose a crucial link to the market, one that champions 'Hecho en México' and brings their craft to the forefront. Without us, the future of retail in Mexico would lose a key driver of change, innovation, and cultural preservation. Our Dream is not just about selling products-it's about leading a movement that redefines what retail means in Mexico, and ensuring that this movement thrives and grows."

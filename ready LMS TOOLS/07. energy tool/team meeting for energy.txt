Key Mistakes to Avoid

2. Avoiding accountability
Failing to own your energy issues. Be honest and upfront about what’s draining you, and commit to solutions.
3. Focusing only on personal gains
This is a team meeting. Don’t focus only on how these changes will benefit you personally; align your energy-boosting habits with team goals.
4. Skipping solutions
Discussing the problems without focusing on actionable solutions is a waste of time. Each issue raised must be followed by a clear strategy.
5. Neglecting follow-through
Agreeing on energy strategies without creating accountability for implementation means the meeting won’t drive real change.

Top 5 Discussion Mistakes to avoid
1. Ignoring the personal impact of energy
Dismissing how energy affects your leadership and your ability to make decisions is a critical error. Energy drives everything. Without it, you can’t perform at your peak.
2. Surface-level sharing
Offering superficial insights instead of deep, thoughtful reflections. The team will only benefit from the meeting if every member is brutally honest about their energy habits and challenges.
3. Skipping actionable solutions
Discussing problems without following through with specific, practical solutions. Ensure that every issue raised leads to a specific action step.
4. Focusing only on individual solutions
This is about team energy. Don’t focus solely on personal gains; look for ways to align your energy-boosting habits with team performance goals.
5. Neglecting follow-through and accountability
Discussing changes without holding yourself accountable for results means nothing. Implementing energy changes must be tracked, measured, and reviewed.

1. Sprint Introduction
Energy Sprint
The Energy Sprint is designed to supercharge human performance by focusing on the four critical elements that fuel energy: Sleep, Food, Movement, and Brain Use. Energy is not a finite resource like time; it can be created, managed, and optimized. The objective of this sprint is to equip participants with the practical tools and strategies to maximize energy in their daily lives, leading to improved productivity, cognitive function, and overall well-being.
Why Energy is the Core of Performance
Energy is our most important resource. It is the engine behind decision-making, creativity, and action. Without energy, none of the other resources—time, money, or talent—matter. This sprint will focus on generating, managing, and replenishing both physical and mental energy.

6. Reflection Time
•	What is the first step you will take to improve your energy through sleep, nutrition, movement, or mental routines?
•	Which area of focus—sleep, food, movement, or brain use—requires the most immediate action in your daily routine?
•	How will you integrate the Fast Track tips into your leadership approach to ensure both you and your team are operating at peak performance?
________________________________________
7. Final Thought: Leadership Begins with Energy
As leaders, our first responsibility is not just crafting the best strategies, implementing cutting-edge technology, or fostering innovation. Our first and most critical responsibility is managing energy—both our own and that of our team. Leadership begins with taking care of the physical and mental energy that drives everything.
•	Obesity shrinks brain tissue by up to 8%, increases the risk of cognitive decline by 74%, and slows decision-making.
•	Poor diet impairs memory by up to 30%, making even routine tasks more mentally draining.
•	Lack of physical activity reduces the generation of new brain cells by 50%, leading to reduced learning capabilities and mental agility.
The first step in becoming a great leader is to focus on sleep, nutrition, movement, and mental resilience. By doing so, you will not only improve your own performance but also inspire those around you to operate at their highest potential. A fast company needs fast, energized people, and that begins with you leading by example.
Takeaway: Leadership is about energy. Without the right energy, even the best strategy will fail. Your first responsibility is to create, manage, and sustain energy in yourself and your team.

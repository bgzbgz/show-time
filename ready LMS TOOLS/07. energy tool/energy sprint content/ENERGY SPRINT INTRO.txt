Energy is everything. It’s the driver of both personal success and team performance. If you can’t manage your energy, you’ll never fully leverage your time or resources.

4. Team Preparation
Purpose: The team meeting is where we align on strategies to maximize not only individual energy but collective team energy. This is a chance to share, challenge, and refine energy-boosting strategies.
Key Mistakes to Avoid:
1.	Surface-Level Discussions: Don’t just skim over your preparation—dive deep into the real habits affecting your energy. Surface-level reflections lead to surface-level results.
2.	Avoiding Accountability: Failing to own your energy issues. Be honest and upfront about what’s draining you, and commit to solutions.
3.	Focusing Only on Personal Gains: This is a team meeting. Don’t focus only on how these changes will benefit you personally; align your energy-boosting habits with team goals.
4.	Skipping Solutions: Discussing the problems without focusing on actionable solutions is a waste of time. Each issue raised must be followed by a clear strategy.
5.	Neglecting Follow-Through: Agreeing on energy strategies without creating accountability for implementation means the meeting won’t drive real change.

6. Top 5 Mistakes to Avoid During the Sprint Discussion
1.	Ignoring the Personal Impact of Energy: Dismissing how energy affects your leadership and your ability to make decisions is a critical error. Energy drives everything—without it, you can’t perform at your peak.
2.	Surface-Level Sharing: Offering superficial insights instead of deep, thoughtful reflections. The team will only benefit from the meeting if every member is brutally honest about their energy habits and challenges.
3.	Skipping Actionable Solutions: Discussing problems without following through with specific, practical solutions. Make sure every issue raised leads to an action step.
4.	Focusing Only on Individual Solutions: This is about team energy. Don’t focus solely on personal gains; look for ways to align your energy-boosting habits with team performance goals.
5.	Neglecting Follow-Through and Accountability: Discussing changes without holding yourself accountable for results means nothing. Implementing energy changes must be tracked, measured, and reviewed.

7. Conclusion: Leadership Begins with Energy
Your first responsibility as a leader is to manage your energy, not just your time. The same applies to your team. If your energy is low, you’re not leading at your full capacity, and neither is your team. This sprint is designed to ensure that you leave with practical, actionable strategies to optimize both individual and team energy, driving higher performance at every level.
Final Call to Action:
Make the changes. Take control of your energy. Lead by example. When your energy is optimized, your team will follow, and your performance will skyrocket.

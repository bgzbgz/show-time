	What I do well (e.g., "I consistently exercise.")
	What I don’t do well (e.g., "I often skip breakfast.")
2.	Set Goals:
	Define clear goals for each area of energy (e.g., "Increase sleep to 7 hours per night").

4. Team Meeting Preparation
•	Purpose: To discuss personal insights, align as a team, and set a collective strategy for maximizing energy across the organization.
•	Discussion Prompts:
1.	Share Key Insights:
	Each member shares 1-2 personal insights they’ve gained about their energy habits.
2.	Analyze Team Energy Flow:
	Identify common themes or patterns across the team (e.g., "Most team members struggle with maintaining sleep routines").

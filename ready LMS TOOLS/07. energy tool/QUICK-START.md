## 🎯 For Participants

### Before You Start

- Set aside **20-30 minutes** uninterrupted
- Be **brutally honest** with your ratings
- Have a clear mind—this requires real reflection
- Know your typical daily schedule/routines

### Tips for Better Results

1. **Lower ratings are good** - They reveal your leverage points
2. **Be specific** - Not "sleep better" but "in bed by 10:30pm, phone outside room"
3. **Make it measurable** - "7.5 hours minimum" not "more sleep"
4. **Start small** - First win should be achievable in 24 hours
5. **Tell someone** - Accountability increases success by 65%

### What Happens Next

After completing:
1. Print/save your protocol
2. Tell your accountability partner
3. Execute your first 24-hour action
4. Bring your protocol to the team Energy Sprint meeting
5. Track your progress weekly

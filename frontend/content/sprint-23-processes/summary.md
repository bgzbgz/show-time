# Sprint 23: Processes - Quick Reference

## Purpose
Design and document efficient, scalable processes that ensure consistent delivery of value.

## Decision to Make
What standardized processes do we need to create, and how do we balance efficiency with flexibility?

## Key Concepts
- **Process Mapping**: Documenting current and desired workflows
- **Process Optimization**: Eliminating waste and bottlenecks
- **Process Management**: Documentation, training, continuous improvement

## Tool Sections
1. Review of Last Sprint - Core activities foundation
2. Reading Materials - Process design and optimization frameworks
3. Think and Do - Map and optimize key processes
4. Team Session - Standardize and document critical processes

## Dependencies
- Requires: Sprint 22 (Core Activities), Sprint 10 (Performance)
- Feeds into: Sprint 27 (Agile Teams), Sprint 28 (Digitalization), Sprint 30 (Implementation)

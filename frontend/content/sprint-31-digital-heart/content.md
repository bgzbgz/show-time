# DIGITALIZATION MADE SIMPLE

## The six core elements determining the speed at which the organization operates
1.  Ability to generate ideas fast
    This usually is a function of the creativity of teams, but also the access to versatile and seemingly unrelated information. We have observed a strong correlation between how much the team members read and their ability to generate new ideas.
2.  Ability to test ideas quickly on a small scale with minimum resources before deciding
3.  Speed of decision-making
4.  Ability to quickly allocate resources to support decisions taken.
    E.g. people, time, cash &other resources.
5.  Ability to adjust the organizational structure.
    Usually, this might require a fundamental shift in the priorities and structure of the organization, which, on the other side, is the biggest impediment to an organization to move fast.

    It is the inability of the organization to make decisions that are normally caused by:
    *   Rigid organizational structure
    *   Risk-averse culture and fear of failure
    *   Slow, indecisive people who lack the sharp mentality of a start-up or a fast-moving organization
6.  Decentralized decision-making.
    In traditional organizations decisions are taken sequentially, where information has to move from one department to another - both horizontally and vertically. The sequential process of decision-making not only slows the organizations down but dilutes responsibility and accountability and feeds the devil of bureaucracy.

## The essence of Agile
Agile is a methodology traditionally introduced and used by IT and software companies. However, this methodology has been successfully adopted and used by many multinational companies like Unilever, Johnson&Johnson, Loreal, etc. It has huge benefits in terms of the speed of organizational development and the ability to solve issues quickly and execute them faster.

Agile transformation is a lengthy process that if done correctly could be a game changer in how a company operates.

### Impact achieved by highly successful agile transformations

## Digitalisation made simple
Many organisations and managers often misunderstand digitalisation. Digitalization is considered as using IT and technology for stock management, accounting, e-commerce, or other processes and documentation in a company. This is what the digitalization of a company used to mean in the 80s and 90s. Today, the advancement of technology and data analytics have created the next wave of digitalization support of decision-making in the organization.

The quality of a business depends to a huge extent on the quality of the decisions taken. The managers who have a vast amount of data and the ability to interpret the data are in a position to make much better and faster decisions than their counterparts. The ultimate goal of data is to help managers make better decisions on an ongoing basis. Data is quickly becoming the ultimate fuel for speed and growth in companies.

To start the process of digitalisation of decision-making, we suggest companies go through the following simple steps:
1.  Determine the core decisions that could be digitalized by using the following matrix.
2.  Identify the sources of data that will facilitate the decision-making process. We suggest that managers go wild and consider any possible sources of data including not only outside the company but also in the industry. These will become the input of your data lake.
3.  Create the technology platform and algorithms to collect and make sense of the data.
4.  Create APIs to enable people in the organization to access and use data in real-time in the most user- friendly fashion.

The next step in the digitalization journey of a company is to eliminate the human in the critical decisions and develop and deploy AI to constantly improve the accuracy of decision-making based on the company’s data.

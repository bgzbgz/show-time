### [04/06] Why Defining Your Core Structure Matters

Your organisational structure directly impacts how swiftly you can execute your strategy. An agile, clearly defined structure ensures teams can make quick decisions, respond rapidly to market changes, and effectively deliver your company’s value proposition.

Without a clear structure, your organisation risks becoming bureaucratic and disconnected from market realities.

#### Step 1: Define Core Activities

##### Objective

Identify the top 5 critical activities driving your value proposition. These are the 20% of actions responsible for 80% of your strategic success.

##### How to Define Core Activities Clearly

To ensure clarity, your core activities must be specific, actionable, and directly linked to your strategy. Avoid vague terms like "Marketing" or "Customer Service." Instead, clearly articulate the activity to reflect its direct impact on strategy.

##### EXAMPLES

**Zara Fashion Retail**
(Value Proposition: Fast, Trend-Responsive Fashion)

*   Deep Customer Insight (rapidly understanding customer trends)
*   Rapid Fashion Design (quickly translating trends into products)
*   Rapid-Response Manufacturing & Operations (fast production and logistics)
*   Globally Consistent Branding & Store Experience (standardized global presence)
*   Efficient Inventory Management (precise stock allocation)

**Company X – Nursing Education**
(Value Proposition: Practical, Job-Ready Nursing Training)

*   Industry-Aligned Course Development (up-to-date, practical nursing curricula)
*   Targeted Student Recruitment & Selective Admissions (high-quality candidate pipeline)
*   Practical, Job-Ready Training (real-world skill-building)
*   Seamless Certification & Workforce Integration (efficient entry into employment)
*   Continuous Professional Upskilling (ongoing training aligned with industry evolution)

##### Common Mistake

Organisations often fail by not clearly specifying activities, resulting in vague strategies and ineffective operations.

#### Step 2: Identify Core Processes

##### Objective

Within each core activity, pinpoint the critical processes essential to consistently executing that activity successfully.

##### How to Identify Core Processes Clearly

List all processes supporting each core activity. Then narrow down to the top three processes per activity, those whose improvement would significantly enhance performance.

##### EXAMPLES

**Zara’s Core Activity: Rapid-Response Manufacturing & Operations**
Processes:

*   Small batch production (allows flexibility)
*   Just-in-time replenishment (reduces waste and inventory holding costs)
*   Vertically integrated logistics (controls speed and cost)

**Company X’s Core Activity: Targeted Student Recruitment & Selective Admissions**
Processes:

*   Identifying high-demand regions for recruitment
*   Career-focused marketing targeting career-changers and young professionals
*   Rigorous admissions screening for motivation and job suitability.

#### Step 3: Establish Clear KPIs for Each Process

##### Objective

Establish measurable indicators (KPIs) to track each process's effectiveness, ensuring processes directly support strategic objectives.

##### How to Identify Core Processes Clearly

For every identified core process, set three clear, measurable KPIs. These KPIs must directly reflect the success of your strategic priorities.

##### EXAMPLES

**Zara’s Core Activity: Deep Customer Insight**
Processes & KPIs:

*   Real-time sales tracking → Sell-through rate (%)
*   Store manager reporting → Customer preference match (%)
*   Trend data collection → Weekly trend adoption rate (%)

**Company X’s Core Activity: Practical, Job-Ready Training**
Processes & KPIs:

*   Simulation-based learning → Student satisfaction scores (%)
*   Integrated internships → Internship-to-job placement rate (%)
*   Ongoing assessment of teaching effectiveness → Graduation rate (%)

##### Common Mistake

Selecting vague or unrelated KPIs can distract teams from strategic goals. Ensure each KPI specifically measures the intended strategic outcome.

### [05/06] CASE STUDIES

#### Example 1: Zara Fashion Retail

#### Example 2: Company X – Nursing Education

**Value Proposition:**
"High-quality, practical, and flexible nursing education tailored to evolving healthcare demands."

**Differentiation:**
Hands-on, career-aligned training that produces job-ready graduates, distinct from traditional theory-focused institutions.

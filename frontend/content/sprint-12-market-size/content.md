### [01/05] TOOLs PREVIEW

Type of tool: team tool

### [02/05] Purpose

This tool enables businesses to estimate their market size and profit pool with simple, actionable calculations. It ensures teams can quickly grasp market opportunities and align strategies with profitability potential.

#### Why this tool matters

Understanding market size and profitability isn’t just a number - it’s the foundation of every strategic decision. This tool provides a clear methodology for calculating these critical metrics, ensuring that decisions are based on real, actionable insights.

### [03/05] Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Define potential customers**
    Estimate the total number of potential customers for your product or service.
    *   Example: For a national service, use census or industry reports to calculate customer population.
2.  **Determine Product/Service Use**
    Estimate the average number of purchases per year per customer.
    *   Example: A household buying cooking oil might purchase 7 liters annually.
3.  **Calculate average spending**
    Determine the average price per unit of your product or service
    *   Example: If the price per liter is $1, enter this figure.
4.  **Calculate Market size**
    Formula: Market Size = Total Customers × Average Spending × Number of Purchases
    *   Example:
        Market Size = 52,500,000 customers × $1 × 1 purchase = $525,000,000
5.  **Estimate Profit pool**
    Formula: Profit Pool = Market Size × Gross Profit Margin (%)

        Profit Pool = $525,000,000 × 2% = $11,760,000

### [04/05] mistakes to avoid

2.  Spending excessive time on data perfection instead of actionable estimates.

### [05/05] f.a.q. and answers

## BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY

### How to create uncontested market space and make the competition irrelevant

**BY W. CHAN KIM & RENEE MAUBORGNE | PENGUIN BOOKS | 2003 | 259 PAGES**

Companies tend to engage in head-to-head competition in search of sustained profitable growth. Yet in today’s overcrowded industries, competing head-on results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Lasting success increasingly comes not from battling competitors but from creating blue oceans of untapped new market spaces ripe for growth.

Blue Ocean Strategy challenges everything you thought you knew about strategic success and provides a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant.

---

### CREATING BLUE OCEANS

#### New Marketspace

Cirque du Soleil succeeded because it realized that to win in the future, companies must stop competing with each other. The only way to beat the competition is to stop trying to beat the competition.

#### From company and industry to strategic move

Consistent with this observation, our study shows that the strategic move, and not the company or the industry, is the right unit of analysis for explaining the creation of blue oceans and sustained high performance. A strategic move is the set of managerial actions and decisions involved in making a major market-creating business offering.

Our analysis failed to find any perpetually excellent company or industry. What we did find behind the seemingly idiosyncratic success stories, however, was a consistent and common pattern across strategic moves for creating and capturing blue oceans.

#### Value innovation: the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy

What consistently separated winners from losers in creating blue oceans was their approach to strategy. The companies caught in the red ocean followed a conventional approach, racing to beat the competition by building a defensible position within the existing industry order. The creators of blue oceans, surprisingly, didn’t use the competition as their benchmark. Instead, they followed a different strategic logic that we call **value innovation**. Value innovation is the cornerstone of the Blue Ocean strategy. We call it value innovation because instead of focusing on beating the competition, you focus on making the competition irrelevant by creating a leap in value for buyers and your company, thereby opening up new and uncontested market space.

Value innovation places equal emphasis on value and innovation. Value without innovation tends to focus on value creation on an incremental scale, something that improves value but is not sufficient to make you stand out in the marketplace. Innovation without value tends to be technology-driven, market-pioneering, or futuristic, often shooting beyond what buyers are ready to accept and pay for.

Importantly, value innovation defies one of the most commonly accepted dogmas of competition-based strategy: the **value-cost trade-off**. It is conventionally believed that companies can either create greater value for customers at a higher cost or create reasonable value at a lower cost. Here, strategy is seen as making a choice between differentiation and low cost. In contrast, those who seek to create blue oceans pursue differentiation and low cost simultaneously.

Value innovation is created in the region where a company’s actions favourably affect both its cost structure and its value proposition to buyers. Cost savings are made by eliminating and reducing the factors an industry competes on. Buyer value is lifted by raising and creating elements the industry has never offered. Over time, costs are reduced further as scale economies kick in due to the high sales volumes that superior value generates.

Because buyer values come from the utility and price that the company offers to buyers and because the value of the company is generated from price and its cost structure, value innovation is achieved only when the whole system of the company’s utility, price, and cost activities is properly aligned.

Competition-based red ocean strategy assumes that an industry’s structural conditions are given and that firms are forced to compete within them, an assumption based on what academics call the **structuralist view** or environmental determinism. In contrast, value innovation is based on the view that market boundaries and industry structure are not given and can be reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players. We call this the **reconstructionist view**.

### ANALYTICAL TOOLS AND FRAMEWORK

Effective blue ocean strategy should be about risk minimization and not risk-taking.

#### The Strategy Canvas

The Strategy canvas is both a diagnostic and an action framework for building a compelling blue ocean strategy. It serves two purposes. First, it captures the current state of play in the known market space. This allows you to understand where the competition is currently investing, the factors the industry currently competes on in products, service, and delivery, and what customers receive from the existing competitive offerings on the market. Figure 2-1 captures all this information in graphic form. The horizontal axis captures the range of factors the industry competes on and invests in.

Now, let’s turn to the vertical axis of the strategy canvas, which captures the offering level that buyers receive across all these competing factors. A high score means that a company offers buyers more and hence invests more in that factor. In the case of price, a higher score indicates a higher price.

The **value curve**, the basic component of the strategy canvas, is a graphic depiction of a company’s relative performance across its industry’s factors of competition.

Despite the plethora of competitors, when premium brand wines are plotted on the strategy canvas, we discover that from the market point of view, all of them essentially have the same strategic profile. They offer a high price and present a high level of offering across all the key competing factors. Their strategic profile follows a classic differentiation strategy. From the market point of view, however, they are all different in the same way. On the other hand, budget wines also have the same essential strategic profile. Their price is low, as is their offering across all the key competing factors. These are classic low-cost players. Moreover, the value curves of premium and low-cost wines share the same basic shape. The two strategic groups’ strategies march in lockstep but at different altitudes of offering levels.

To set a company on a strong, profitable growth trajectory in the face of these industry conditions, it won’t work to benchmark competitors and try to outcompete them by offering a little more for a little less.

To fundamentally shift the strategy canvas of an industry, you must begin by reorientating your strategic focus from competitors to alternatives and from customers to noncustomers of the industry.

Casella Wines was ready to explore how to redraw the strategic profile of the U.S. wine industry to create a blue ocean. To achieve this, it turned to the second basic analytic underlying blue oceans: the **four actions framework**.

#### The Four Actions Framework

It is by pursuing the first two questions (of eliminating and reducing) that you gain insight into how to drop your cost structure vis-à-vis competitors. Our research has found that rarely do managers systematically set out to eliminate and reduce their investments in factors that an industry competes on. The result is mounting cost structures and complex business models. The second two factors, by contrast, provide you with insight into how to lift buyer value and create new demand. Collectively, they allow you to systematically explore how you can reconstruct buyer value elements across alternative industries to offer buyers an entirely new experience, while simultaneously keeping your cost structure low. Of particular importance are the actions of eliminating and creating, which push companies to go beyond value maximization exercises with existing factors of competition.

#### The Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create Grid

There is a third tool that is key to the creation of blue oceans. It is a supplementary analytic to the four actions framework called the **eliminate-reduce-raise-create grid** (see Figure 2-4). The grid pushes companies not only to ask all four questions in the four actions framework but also to act on all four to create a new value curve.

#### Three characteristics of a good strategy

Yellow Tail, like Cirque du Soleil, created a unique and exceptional value curve to unlock a blue ocean. As shown in the strategy canvas, Yellow tail’s value curve was focused; the company does not diffuse its efforts across all key factors of competition. The shape of its value curve diverges from the other players, a result of not benchmarking competitors but instead looking across alternatives.

When expressed through a value curve, then, an effective blue ocean strategy like Yellow tail’s has three complementary qualities: **focus, divergence, and a compelling tagline**. Without these qualities, a company’s strategy will likely be muddled, undifferentiated, and hard to communicate with a high-cost structure.

##### Focus

Every great strategy has focus, and a company’s strategic profile, or value curve, should clearly show it. Looking at Southwest’s profile, we can see at once that the company emphasizes only three factors: friendly service, speed, and frequent point-to-point departures.

##### Divergence

When a company’s strategy is formed reactively as it tries to keep up with the competition, it loses its uniqueness.

By applying the four actions of eliminating, reducing, raising, and creating, they differentiate their profiles from the industry’s average profile.

##### Compelling Tagline

A good strategy has a clear-cut and compelling tagline. “The speed of a plane at the price of a car – whenever you need it”. That’s the tagline of Southwest Airlines, or at least it could be.

A good tagline must not only deliver a clear message but also advertise an offering truthfully, or else customers will lose trust and interest. In fact, a good way to test the effectiveness and strength of a strategy is to look at whether it contains a strong and authentic tagline.

#### Reading the Values Curves

##### Overdelivering Without Payback

When a company’s value curve on the strategy canvas is shown to deliver high levels across all factors, the question is, does the company’s market share and profitability reflect these investments? If not, the strategy canvas signals that the company may be oversupplying its customers, offering too many of those elements that add incremental value to buyers. To value-innovate, the company must decide which factors to eliminate and reduce – and not only those to raise and create – to construct a divergent value curve.

##### An Internally Driven Company

In drawing the strategy canvas, how does a company label the industry’s competing factors? For example, does it use the word megahertz instead of speed or thermal water temperature instead of hot water? Are the competing factors stated in terms buyers can understand and value, or are they in operational jargon? The kind of language used in the strategy canvas gives insight as to whether a company’s strategic vision is built on an “outside-in” perspective, driven by the demand side, or an “inside-out” perspective that is operationally driven. Analyzing the language of the strategy canvas helps a company understand how far it is from creating industry demand.

### RECONSTRUCT MARKET BOUNDARIES

The first principle of blue ocean strategy is to reconstruct market boundaries to break from the competition and create blue oceans.

We found clear patterns for creating blue oceans. Specifically, we found six basic approaches to remaking market boundaries. We call this the **six paths framework**.

These paths challenge the six fundamental assumptions underlying many companies’ strategies. These six assumptions, on which most companies hypnotically build their strategies, keep companies trapped competing in red oceans. Specifically, companies tend to do the following:

*   Define their industry similarly and focus on being the best within it
*   Look at their industries through the lens of generally accepted strategic groups (such as luxury automobiles, economy cars, and family vehicles), and strive to stand out in the strategic group they play in
*   Focus on the same buyer group, be it the purchaser (as in the office equipment industry), the use (as in the clothing industry), or the influencer (as in the pharmaceutical industry)
*   Define the scope of the products and services offered by their industry similarly
*   Accept their industry’s functional or emotional orientation
*   Focus on the same point in time – and often on current competitive threats – in formulating strategy

#### Path 1: Look Across Alternative Industries

In the broadest sense, a company competes not only with the other firms in its own industry but also with companies in those other industries that produce alternative products or services. Alternatives are broader than substitutes. Products or services that have different forms but offer the same functionality or core utility are often substitutes for each other. On the other hand, alternatives include products or services that have different functions and forms but the same purpose.

In making every purchase decision, buyers implicitly weigh alternatives, often unconsciously.

The strategic question is, Why would corporations choose one alternative industry over another? By focusing on the key factors that lead corporations to trade across alternatives and eliminating or reducing everything else, NetJets created its blue ocean strategy.

By offering the best of commercial travel and private jets and eliminating and reducing everything else, NetJets opened up a multibillion-dollar blue ocean wherein customers get the convenience and speed of a private jet with a low fixed cost and the low variable cost of commercial airline travel (see figure 3-1).

NTT DoCoMo asked, What are the distinctive strengths of the Internet over cell phones, and vice versa?

NTT DoCoMo broke the trade-off between these two alternatives, not by creating new technology but by focusing on the decisive advantages that the Internet has over the cell phone and vice versa. The company eliminated or reduced everything else.

**What are the alternative industries to your industry? Why do customers trade across them? By focusing on the key factors that lead buyers to trade across alternative industries and eliminating or reducing everything else, you can create a blue ocean of new market space.**

#### Path 2: Look Across Strategic Groups Within Industries

Just as blue oceans can often be created by looking across alternative industries, so can they be unlocked by looking across strategic groups. The term refers to a group of companies within an industry that pursue a similar strategy.

Strategic groups can generally be ranked in a rough hierarchical order built on two dimensions: price and performance. Each jump in price tends to bring a corresponding jump in some dimensions of performance.

The key to creating a blue ocean across existing strategic groups is to break out of this narrow tunnel vision by understanding which factors determine customers’ decisions to trade up or down from one group to another.

Curves built on the decisive advantages of two strategic groups in the U.S. fitness industry – traditional health clubs and home exercise programs – and eliminated or reduced everything else.

Curves has eliminated all the aspects of the traditional health club that are of little interest to the broad mass of women. Gone are the profusion of special machines, food, spa, pool, and even locker rooms, which have been replaced by a few curtained-off changing areas.

**What are the strategic groups in your industry? Why do customers trade up for the higher group, and why do they trade down for the lower one?**

#### Path 3: Look Across the Chain of Buyers

In most industries, competitors converge around a common definition of who the target buyer is. In reality, there is a chain of “buyers” who are directly or indirectly involved in the buying decision. The purchasers who pay for the product or service may differ from the actual users, and in some cases, there are important influencers as well.

Challenging an industry’s conventional wisdom about which buyer group to target can lead to the discovery of a new blue ocean. By looking across buyer groups, companies can gain new insights into how to redesign their value curves to focus on a previously overlooked set of buyers.

**What is the chain of buyers in your industry? Which buyer group does your industry typically focus on? If you shifted the buyer group of your industry, how could you unlock new value?**

#### Path 4: Look Across Complementary Product and Service Offerings

Few products and services are used in a vacuum. In most cases, other products and services affect their value. But in most industries, rivals converge within the bounds of their industry’s product and service offerings. Take movie theatres. The ease and cost of getting a babysitter and parking the car affect the perceived value of going to the movies. Yet these complementary services are beyond the bounds of the movie theatre industry as it has been traditionally defined.

Untapped value is often hidden in complementary products and services. The key is to define the total solution buyers seek when they choose a product or service. A simple way to do so is to think about what happens before, during, and after your product is used.

Why were bus companies focused only on the initial purchase price of the bus when municipalities kept buses in circulation for twelve years on average? When it framed the market in this way, NABI saw insights that had escaped the entire industry.

**What is the context in which your product or service is used? What happens before, during, and after? Can you identify the pain points? How can you eliminate these pain points through a complimentary product or service offering?**

#### Path 5: Look Across Functional or Emotional Appeal to Buyers

Some industries compete principally on price and function largely on calculations of utility; their appeal is rational. Other industries compete largely on feelings; their appeal is emotional. Yet the appeal of most products or services is rarely intrinsically one or the other.

When companies are willing to challenge the functional-emotional orientation of their industry, they often find new market space. We have observed two common patterns. Emotionally oriented industries offer many extras that add price without enhancing functionality. Stripping away those extras may create a fundamentally simpler, lower-priced, lower-cost business model that customers would welcome. Conversely, functionally oriented industries can often infuse commodity products with new life by adding a dose of emotion and, in so doing, can stimulate new demand.

In the United States, The Vanguard Group (in index funds) and Charles Schwab (in brokerage services) are doing the same thing in the investment industry, creating a blue ocean by transforming emotionally oriented businesses based on personal relationships into high-performance, low-cost, functional businesses.

**Does your industry compete on functionality or emotional appeal? If you compete on emotional appeal, what elements can you strip out to make it functional? If you compete on functionality, what elements can be added to make it emotional?**

#### Path 6: Look Across Time

All industries are subject to external trends that affect their businesses over time. Most companies adapt incrementally and somewhat passively as events unfold.

But key insights into blue ocean strategy rarely come from projecting the trend itself. Instead they arise from business insights into how the trend will change value to customers and impact the company’s business model. By looking across time – from the value a market delivers today to the value it might deliver tomorrow – managers can actively shape their future and lay claim to a new blue ocean.

Three principles are critical to assessing trends across time. To form the basis of a blue ocean strategy, these trends must be **decisive** to your business, they must be **irreversible**, and they must have a **clear trajectory**.

Having identified a trend of this nature, you can then look across time and ask yourself what the market would look like if the trend were taken to its logical conclusion. Working back from that vision of a blue ocean strategy, you can identify what must be changed today to unlock a new blue ocean.

For example, Apple observed the flood of illegal music file sharing that began in the late 1990s. Apple capitalized on this decisive trend with a clear trajectory by launching iTunes online music store in 2003.

**What trends have a high probability of impacting your industry, are irreversible, and are evolving in a clear trajectory. How will these trends impact your industry? Given this, how can you open up unprecedented customer utility?**

#### Conceiving New Market Space

---

### FOCUS ON THE BIG PICTURE, NOT THE NUMBERS

Our research reveals that most companies’ strategic planning process keeps them wedded to red oceans. The process tends to drive companies to compete within existing market space.

In this process, managers spend the majority of strategic thinking time filling in boxes and running numbers instead of thinking outside the box and developing a clear picture of how to break from the competition.

A closer look reveals that most plans don’t contain a strategy at all but rather a smorgasbord of tactics that individually make sense but collectively don’t add up to a unified, clear direction that sets a company apart – let alone makes the competition irrelevant. Does this sound like the strategic plans in your company?

This brings us to the second principle of the blue ocean strategy: **Focus on the big picture, not the numbers**. This principle is key to mitigating the planning risk of investing lots of effort and lots of time but delivering only tactical red ocean moves.

#### Focusing on the Big Picture

By building a company’s strategic planning process around a strategy canvas, a company and its managers focus their main attention on the big picture rather than becoming immersed in numbers and jargon and getting caught up in operational details.

As discussed in Chapter 2, the strategic profile with high blue ocean potential has three complementary qualities: focus, divergence, and a compelling tagline.

#### Drawing Your Strategy Canvas

Indeed, when we ask executives what prompts them to seek out blue oceans and introduce change, they usually say that it takes a highly determined leader or a serious crisis.

Fortunately, we’ve found that asking executives to draw the value curve of their company’s strategy brings home the need for change. It serves as a forceful wake-up call for companies to challenge their existing strategies.

Getting the wake-up call is only the first step. The next step is to send a team into the field, putting managers face-to-face with what they must sense of: how people use or don’t use their products or services.

In the process, each was to interview and observe ten people involved in corporate foreign exchange, including lost customers, new customers, and the customers of EFS’s competitors and alternatives. The managers also reached outside the industry’s traditional boundaries to companies that did not yet use corporate foreign exchange services but that might in the future, such as Internet-based companies with a global reach like Amazon.com.

##### Step 3: Visual Strategy Fair

After two weeks of drawing and redrawing, the teams presented their strategy canvases at what we call a **visual strategy fair**. Attendees included senior corporate executives but consisted mainly of representatives of EFS’s external constituencies – the kinds of people the managers had met with during their field trips, including noncustomers, customers of competitors, and some of the most demanding EFS customers.

They also learned that buyers from all markets had a basic set of needs and expected similar services. If you met those common needs, customers would happily forgo everything else. Regional differences became significant only when there was a problem with the basics.

##### Step 4: Visual Communication

After the future strategy is set, the last step is to communicate it in a way that can be easily understood by any employee. EFS distributed the one-page picture showing its new and old strategic profiles so that every employee could see where the company stood and where it had to focus its efforts to create a compelling future.

#### Visualizing Strategy at the Corporate Level

Using the **Pioneer-Migrator-Settler (PMS) Map**, all the companies that created blue oceans in our study have been pioneers in their industries, not necessarily in developing new technologies but in pushing the value they offer customers to new frontiers.

A company’s **pioneers** are the businesses that offer unprecedented value. These are your blue ocean strategies, and they are the most powerful sources of profitable growth. These businesses have a mass following of customers. Their value curve diverges from the competition on the strategy canvas. At the other extreme are **settlers** – businesses whose value curves conform to the basic shape of the industries. These are me-too businesses. Settlers will not generally contribute much to a company’s future growth. They are stuck within the red ocean.

The potential of **migrators** lies somewhere in between. Such businesses extend the industry’s curve by giving customers more for less, but they don’t alter their basic shape. These businesses offer improved value but not innovative value. These are businesses whose strategies fall on the margin between red oceans and blue oceans.

Revenue, profitability, market share, and customer satisfaction are all measures of a company’s current position. Contrary to what conventional strategic thinking suggests, those measures cannot point the way to the future; changes in the environment are too rapid. Today’s market share is a reflection of how well a business has performed historically.

Chief executives should instead use value and innovation as the important parameters for managing their portfolio of businesses. They should use innovation because, without it, companies are stuck in the trip of competitive improvements. They should use value because innovative ideas will be profitable only if they are linked to what buyers are willing to pay for.

### REACH BEYOND EXISTING DEMAND

Instead of concentrating on customers, they need to look to noncustomers. And instead of focusing on customer differences, they need to build on powerful commonalities in what buyers value. That allows companies to reach beyond existing demand to unlock a new mass of customers that did not exist before.

#### The three tiers of non-customers

There are three tiers of noncustomers that can be transformed into customers. They differ in their relative distance from your market.

The **first tier of noncustomers** is closest to your market. They sit on the edge of the market. They are buyers who minimally purchase an industry’s offering out of necessity but are mentally non- consumers of the industry.

The **second tier of noncustomers** is people who refuse to use your industry’s offerings. These are buyers who have seen your industry’s offerings as an option to fulfil their needs but have voted against them.

The **third tier of noncustomers** is farthest from your market. They offer noncustomers who have never thought of your market’s offerings as an option. By focusing on key commonalities across these noncustomers and existing customers, companies can understand how to pull them into their new market.

These first-tier noncustomers were in search of better solutions. Although there were numerous differences across them, they shared three key commonalities: They wanted lunch fast, they wanted it fresh and healthy, and they wanted it at a reasonable price.

**What are the key reasons first-tier noncustomers want to jump ship and leave your industry? Look for the commodities across their responses. Focus on these, and not on the differences between them. You will glean insight into how to desegment buyers and unlease an ocean of latent untapped demand.**

**What are the key reasons second-tier noncustomers refuse to use the products or services of your industry? Look for the commonalities across their responses. Focus on these, and not on their differences. You will glean insight into how to unleash an ocean of latent untapped demand.**

#### Go for the Biggest Catchment

There is no hard-and-fast rule to suggest which tier of noncustomers you should focus on and when.

But you should also explore whether there are overlapping commonalities across all three tiers of noncustomers. In that way, you can expand the scope of latent demand you can unleash.

The point here is not to argue that it’s wrong to focus on existing customers or segmentation but rather to challenge those existing, taken-for-granted strategic orientations.

### GETTING THE STRATEGIC SEQUENCE RIGHT

#### The right strategic sequence

1.  The starting point is **buyer utility**. Does your offering unlock exceptional utility? Is there a compelling reason for the mass of people to buy it? Absent this, there is no blue ocean potential to begin with. Here there are only two options. Park the idea, or rethink it until you reach an affirmative answer.
2.  Is your offering **priced** to attract the mass of target buyers so that they have a compelling ability to pay for your offering? If it is not, they cannot buy it. Nor will the offering create irresistible market buzz.
3.  Can you **profit** at the strategic price – the price easily accessible to the mass of target buyers? You should not let costs drive prices. Nor should you scale down utility because high costs block your ability to profit at the strategic price. When the target costs cannot be met, you must either forgo the idea because the blue ocean won’t be profitable, or you must innovate your business model to hit the target cost.
4.  What are the **adoption hurdles** in rolling out your idea? Have you addressed these up front?
    *   Adoption hurdles include, for example, potential resistance to the idea by retailers or partners.

#### Testing for exceptional utility

The **buyer utility map** helps managers look at this issue from the right perspective (see figure 6-2). It outlines all the levers companies can pull to deliver exceptional utility to buyers as well as the various experiences buyers can have with a product or service. This map allows managers to identify the full range of utility spaces that a product or service can potentially fill.

##### The six utility levers

The greatest blocks to utility often represent the greatest and most pressing opportunities to unlock exceptional value.

If your offering falls on the same space or spaces as those of other players, chances are it is not a blue ocean offering.

**Where are the greatest blocks to utility across the buyer experience cycle for your customers and noncustomers? Does your offering effectively eliminate these blocks? If it does not, chances are your offering is innovation for innovation’s sake or a revision of existing offerings.**

#### From exceptional utility to strategic pricing

To secure a strong revenue stream for your offering, you must set the right strategic price. This step ensures that buyers not only will want to buy your offering but also will have a compelling ability to pay for it.

Companies must therefore start with an offer that buyers can’t refuse and must keep it that way to discourage any free-riding imitations. This is what makes strategic pricing key. Strategic pricing addresses this question: Is your offering priced to attract the mass of target buyers from the start so that they have a compelling ability to pay for it? When exceptional utility is combined with strategic pricing, imitation is discouraged.

We have developed a tool called the **price corridor of the mass** to help managers find the right price for an irresistible offer, which, by the way, isn’t necessarily the lower price. The tool involves two distinct but interrelated steps (see figure 6-5).

They key here is not to pursue pricing against the competition within an industry but rather to pursue pricing against substitutes and alternatives across industries and nonindustries. Had Ford, for example, priced its Model T against other autos, which were more than three times the price of horse-drawn carriages, the market for the Model T would not have exploded.

##### Step 2: Specify a level within the price corridor

Companies would be wise to pursue mid-to-lower-boundary strategic pricing from the start if any of the following apply:

*   Their blue ocean offering has high fixed costs and marginal variable costs
*   Their attractiveness depends heavily on network externalities
*   Their cost structure benefits from steep economics of scale and scope. In these cases, volume brings with it significant cost advantages, something that makes pricing for volume even more key.

#### From strategic pricing to target costing

**Target costing**, the next step in the strategic sequence, addresses the profit side of the business model. To maximize the profit potential of a blue ocean idea, a company should start with the strategic price and then deduct its desired profit margin from the price to arrive at the target cost. Here, price-minus costing, and not cost-plus pricing, is essential if you are to arrive at a cost structure that is both profitable and hard for potential followers to match.

**Can high-cost, low-value-added activities in your value chain be significantly eliminated, reduced, or outsourced?**

### OVERCOME KEY ORGANIZATIONAL HURDLES

Companies, like individuals, often have a tough time translating thought into action whether in red or blue oceans. But compared with red ocean strategy, blue ocean strategy represents a significant departure from the status quo. It hinges on a shift from convergence to divergence in value curves at lower costs. That raises the execution bar.

Managers have assured us that the challenge is steep. They face four hurdles:

1.  **Cognitive**: waking employees up to the need for a strategic shift. Red oceans may not be the paths to future profitable growth, but they feel comfortable to people and may have even served an organization well until now, so why rock the boat?
2.  **Limited resources**: The greater the shift in strategy, the greater it is assumed are the resources needed to execute it.
3.  **Motivation**: How do you motivate key players to move fast and tenaciously to carry out a break from the status quo?
4.  **Politics**: As one manager put it, “In our organization you get shot down before you stand up”.

**Tipping point leadership** allows you to overcome these four hurdles fast and at low cost while winning employees’ backing in executing a break from the status quo.

#### The pivotal lever: Disproportionate influence factors

Tipping point leadership traces its roots to the field of epidemiology and the theory of tipping points.

Tipping point leadership builds on the rarely exploited corporate reality that in every organization, there are people, acts, and activities that exercise a disproportionate influence on performance.

#### Break through the cognitive hurdle

Tipping point leadership does not rely on numbers to break through the organization’s cognitive hurdle. To tip the cognitive hurdle fast, tipping point leaders such as Bratton zoom in on the act of disproportionate influence: making people see and experience harsh reality firsthand.

Tipping point leadership builds on this insight to inspire a fast change in mindset that is internally driven of people’s own accord. Instead of relying on numbers to tip the cognitive hurdle, they make people experience the need for change in two ways.

##### Ride the “Electric Sewer”

To break the status quo, employees must come face-to-face with the worst operational problems.

##### Meet with Disgruntled Customers

To tip the cognitive hurdle, not only must you get your managers out of the office to see operational horror, but you must also get them to listen to their most disgruntled customers firsthand. Don’t rely on market surveys.

#### Jump the Resources Hurdle

When it comes to scarce resources, there are three factors of disproportionate influence that executives can leverage to dramatically free resources, on the one hand, and multiply the values of resources, on the other. These are **hot spots, cold spots, and horse-trading**.

**Hot Spots** are activities that have low resource input but high potential performance gains. In contrast, **cold spots** are activities that have high resource input but low-performance impact. In every organization, hot spots and cold spots typically abound. **Horse trading** involves trading your unit’s excess resources in one area for another unit’s excess resources to fill remaining resource gaps. By learning to use their current resources right, companies often find they can tip the resource hurdle outright.

#### Jump the Motivational Hurdle

Instead of diffusing change efforts widely, tipping point leaders follow a reverse course and seek massive concentration. They focus on three factors of disproportionate influence in motivating employees, what we call **kingpins, fishbowl management, and atomization**.

##### Zoom in on Kingpins

To trigger an epidemic movement of positive energy, however, you should not spread your efforts then. Rather, you should concentrate your efforts on **kingpins**, the key influencers in the organization.

##### Place Kingpins in a Fishbowl

At the heart of motivating the kingpins in a sustained and meaningful way is to shine a spotlight on their actions in a repeated and highly visible way. This is what we refer to as **fishbowl management**, where kingpins’ actions and inaction are made as transparent to others as are fish in a bowl of water.

#### Secure a Consigliere on Your Top Management Team

To knock down the political hurdles, you should also ask yourself two sets of questions:

*   Who are my devils? Who will fight me? Who will lose the most by the future blue ocean strategy?
*   Who are my angels? Who will naturally align with me? Who will gain the most from the strategic shift?

Don’t fight alone. Get the higher and wider voice to fight with you. Identify your detractors and supporters – forget the middle – and strive to create a win-win outcome for both. But move quickly. Isolate your detractors by building a broader coalition with your angels before a battle begins. In this way, you will discourage the war before it has a chance to start or gain a stream.

The key to winning over your detractors or devils is knowing all their likely angels of attack and building up counterarguments backed by irrefutable facts and reason.

### BUILD EXECUTION INTO STRATEGY

#### The Three “E” Principles of Fair Process

There are three mutually reinforcing elements that define fair process: **engagement, explanation, and clarity of expectation**. Whether people are senior executives or shop floor employees, they all look to these elements. We call them the three E principles of fair process.

*   **Engagement** means involving individuals in the strategic decisions that affect them by asking for their input and allowing them to refute the merits of one another’s ideas and assumptions.
*   **Explanation** means that everyone involved and affected should understand why final strategic decisions are made as they are. An explanation of the thinking that underlies decisions makes people confident that managers have considered their opinions and have made decisions impartially in the overall interests of the company.
*   **Expectation** clarity requires that after a strategy is set, managers state clearly the new rules of the game. Although the expectations may be demanding, employees should know up front what standards they will be judged by and the penalties for failure. What are the goals of the new strategy? What are the new targets and milestones? Who is responsible for what? To achieve a fair process, it matters less what the new goals, expectations, and responsibilities are and more that they are clearly understood.

Taken together, these three criteria collectively lead to judgments of fair process. This is important because any subset of the three does not create judgments of fair process.

#### Why does fair process matter?

Emotionally, individuals seek recognition of their value, not as “labor”, “personnel”, or “human resources” but as human beings who are treated with full respect and dignity and appreciated for their individual worth regardless of hierarchical level. Intellectually, individuals seek recognition that their ideas are sought after and given thoughtful reflection, and that others think enough of their intelligence to explain their thinking to them.

##### Intellectual and emotional recognition theory

However, there is a flip side to this that is deserving of equal, if not more, attention: the violation of fair process and, with it, the violation of recognizing individuals’ intellectual and emotional worth.

If individuals are not treated as though their knowledge is valued, they will feel intellectual indignation and will not share their ideas and expertise; rather, they will hoard their best thinking and creative ideas, preventing new insights from seeing the light of day. What’s more, they will reject others’ intellectual worth as well. It’s as if they were saying “You don’t value my ideas. So I don’t value your ideas, nor do I trust in or care about the strategic decisions you’ve reached”.

Similarly, to the extent that people’s emotional worth is not recognized, they will feel angry and will not invest their energy in their actions; rather, they will drag their feet and apply counter-efforts, including sabotage, as in the case of Elco’s Chester plant.

### CONCLUSION: THE SUSTAINABILITY AND RENEWAL OF BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY

*   Value innovation does not make sense to a company’s conventional logic
*   Blue ocean strategy may conflict with other companies’ brand image
*   Natural monopoly: The market often cannot support a second player
*   Patents or legal permits block imitation
*   High volume leads to rapid cost advantage for the value innovator, discouraging followers from entering the market
*   Network externalities discourage imitation
*   Imitation often requires significant political, operational, and cultural changes
*   Companies that value-innovate earn brand buzz and a loyal customer following that tends to shun imitators

#### When to Value-Innovate Again

Eventually, however, almost every blue ocean strategy will be imitated. As imitators try to grab a share of your blue ocean, you typically launch offences to defend your hard-earned customer base. But imitators often persist. Obsessed with hanging on to market share, you may fall into the trap of competing, racing to beat the new competition. Over time, the competition, and not the buyer, may come to occupy the centre of your strategic thought and actions. If you stay on this course, the basic shape of your value curve will begin to converge with those of the competition.

When the company’s value curve still has focus, divergence, and a compelling tagline, you should resist the temptation to value-innovate again and instead should focus on lengthening, widening, and deepening your rent stream through operational improvements and geographical expansion to achieve maximum economies of scale and market coverage.

As rivalry intensifies and total supply exceeds demand, bloody competition commences and the ocean will turn red. As competitors’ value curves converge towards yours, you should begin reaching out for another value innovation to create a new blue ocean. Hence, by charting your value curve on the strategy canvas and intermittently replotting your competitors’ value curves versus your own, you will be able to visually see the degree of imitation, and hence of value curve convergence and the extent to which your blue ocean is turning red.

### APPENDIX – VALUE INNOVATION (A RECONSTRUCTIONIST VIEW OF STRATEGY)

By stimulating the demand side of the economy, the strategy of value innovation expands existing markets and creates new ones. Value innovators achieve a leap in value by creating new wealth rather than at the expense of competitors in the traditional sense. Such a strategy therefore allows firms to largely play a non-zero-sum game, with high payoff possibilities.

Looking at the demand side, in contrast, reconstruction breaks away from the cognitive bounds set by existing rules of competition. It focuses on redefining the existing problem itself. Cirque du Soleil, for example, is not about offering a better circus by recombining existing knowledge or technologies about acts and performances. Rather, it is about reconstructing existing buyer value elements to create a new form of entertainment that offers the fun and thrill of the circus with the intellectual sophistication of the theatre.

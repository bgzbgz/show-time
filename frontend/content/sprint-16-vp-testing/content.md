### [02/05] Review of Last Sprint and Learnings
(10 minutes)

Take a moment to review what you learned from the last sprint. These questions will help you crystallize your insights and think about how to apply them practically:
Write your reflections, allowing yourself to be brutally honest about what worked and what didn’t.

### [03/05] Reading for This Week
(20 minutes)

Imagine this reading as sharpening your sword before a battle. The better you understand and internalize these concepts, the more effective you’ll be in the challenges ahead.
Before diving into the reading, consider these questions to prime your mind:

#### Tune-in questions
1.  What's the one thing your customers must instantly understand about your offer, no questions asked?
2.  If your customer had to describe your value in one sentence, what do you wish they'd say?
3.  Right now, what's the biggest uncertainty you have about how customers see your value?

#### Reading materials
1.  **BRAIN JUICE**
    [EXPECTED TIME: 15 MIN]
    Final value test: customer meeting guide

### [04/05] think and do
(60 minutes)

#### think
Reflect on the materials you will read and how they relate to your company. Consider the following:
1.  How will I make sure customers give me brutally honest reactions instead of polite feedback?
2.  Am I fully clear on the exact words and message I'll test, and how will I present it without bias?
3.  What specific signs of hesitation or confusion I should be watching out for during the interviews?

### [05/05] Mind Rehearsal
(10 minutes)

Your role in the team meeting is to challenge, refine, and sharpen the value proposition. Mentally rehearse how you will contribute by:

1.  What's the most consistent, positive reaction from customers?
2.  Where do customers still hesitate or get confused?
3.  What's the single strongest differentiator customers identify?

#### Final Tips
##### Priority Setting
Dedicate uninterrupted time to preparation. Focus on insights that will have the highest impact during team discussions.

##### Application of Fast Track principles
*   **80/20 Rule:** Concentrate on the vital few segments that drive the majority of opportunities.
*   **Brutal Honesty:** Challenge assumptions and be transparent about limitations in your analysis.

##### Action Obsession
Come ready with real solutions, not just observations.

# MODULE: STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT - SPRINT: VALUE PROPOSITION TEST

## brain juice

### [01/09] ObjectivE
This second and final round of customer interviews is designed to validate the updated value proposition with high confidence. The goal is to:
*   Confirm that the new message lands clearly and persuasively.
*   Identify any remaining friction points or hesitations.
*   Ensure that customers see the offer as compelling and action-worthy.
*   Finalize key wording before fully implementing the value proposition.

At the end of these interviews, we should have a tested, bulletproof value proposition that drives predictable, strong reactions across multiple customers. If feedback is still inconsistent, we refine again.

### [02/09] Guiding Principles: What’s Different in This Round?
1.  **Less Discovery, More Validation.**
    *   First round: Identifying objections and confusion points.
    *   Second round: Confirming that objections are resolved and messaging is sharp.
    *   Ensure that customers see the offer as compelling and action-worthy.
    *   Finalize key wording before fully implementing the value proposition.
2.  **We look for consistency.**
    *   If customers react the same way, we’ve nailed it.
    *   If reactions vary widely, there’s still work to do.
3.  **We push for real reactions.**
    *   We want customers to either love it or have clear concerns - neutral feedback is useless.

### [03/09] Meeting Structure (30–40 min max)
1.  **Introduction** (5 min)
    *   Thank them again for their time.
    *   Set expectations: “We’ve refined our message based on feedback, and we want to confirm how it resonates now.”
    *   Establish trust: “Your candid thoughts will help us make the final improvements.”
2.  **Reconfirm the Problem** (5 min)
    *   “Last time, you mentioned [specific problem]. Is this still your biggest challenge?”
    *   “Are you still solving it the same way?”
    *   “Has anything changed in your priorities since we last spoke?”
    *   If their problem has shifted, it could indicate market movement.
    *   If urgency has dropped, the offer may need repositioning.
3.  **Presenting the Final Value Proposition** (10 min)
    *   Share the updated one-liner and expanded explanation.
    *   Pause. Observe. Let them react.
    *   Follow-up questions:
        *   “Does this immediately make sense?”
        *   “What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you hear this?”
        *   “Does this sound like something you would actually use?”
        *   “Does this sound different from other options you’ve considered?”
        *   “Is anything still unclear?”
    *   We’re looking for enthusiasm and clarity.
    *   If they hesitate, probe into why.
    *   If they reinterpret the message, note how they phrase it.
4.  **Testing the Call to Action** (10 min)
    *   “What would make you act on this today?”
    *   “What would stop you from moving forward?”
    *   “If this were available now, what would your next step be?”
    *   “Would you recommend this to others?” If so, who?”
    *   If they can’t see themselves acting, it’s still too weak.
    *   Look for hesitation - every hesitation is an insight.
    *   A strong value proposition should make taking action feel natural.
5.  **Closing** (5 min)
    *   Thank them for their time.
    *   Summarize key takeaways from their input.
    *   Ask if they’d be open to a follow-up when the product is finalized.
    *   Optional: If they show strong interest, explore potential pilot opportunities.

### [04/09] Do’s & Don’ts

| Do                                                              | Don’t                                                              |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Let them talk - your job is to listen.                          | Over-explain - if they don’t get it immediately, the message still needs work. |
| Push for real reactions, not politeness.                        | Lead them - don’t try to get the answer you want.                  |
| Confirm if the message creates clarity, urgency, and action.    | Accept “it’s fine” as an answer - push for specifics.              |
| Test whether they see themselves using it.                      | Dismiss hesitation - every hesitation is a clue.                   |

### [05/09] After the Meeting: Capture Your Insights
Fill out a quick summary:
1.  What worked well? (What made them react positively?)
2.  What was unclear? (Where did they hesitate or need more explanation?)
3.  What concerns did they still have? (Why would they not move forward?)
4.  How did they describe the solution in their own words? (Did they naturally rephrase it?)
5.  What’s the final adjustment needed? (Last tweak before full rollout.)

**Goal:** If multiple customers react the same way, we now have a fully tested, final value proposition that is ready to launch.

# MODULE: STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT - SPRINT: VALUE PROPOSITION TEST

## TEAM MEETING PREPARATION GUIDE

### [01/05] Purpose of the Meeting
#### Objective
This meeting is designed to analyze and refine the value proposition based on real customer feedback from the first round of interviews. The goal is to:
*   Identify what worked well - what customers responded positively to.
*   Pinpoint what didn’t resonate - any confusion, hesitation, or pushback.
*   Uncover hidden objections - reasons customers may hesitate or reject the offer.
*   Adjust the value proposition based on insights to make it sharper, clearer, and more compelling.

#### Why this matters
*   A value proposition only works if it lands the first time with customers.
*   This process ensures predictability - if multiple customers react the same way, it’s a pattern.
*   Weak spots must be fixed now - before launching externally or investing in marketing.

### [02/05] Pre-Mortem
#### Potential issues that could derail the meeting
*   Jumping to conclusions too fast - assuming one person’s reaction applies to everyone.
*   Focusing on opinions, not patterns - one off-hand comment doesn’t mean a change is needed.
*   Defending the original idea - the point is to improve, not justify what exists.
*   Overcomplicating the message - adding too much instead of refining what’s essential.

#### Preventive strategies
*   Stick to patterns - If three or more customers say it, it’s real feedback.
*   Use evidence, not feelings - Base discussions on actual interview data.
*   Prioritize clarity over complexity - Refine the message, don’t overload it.
*   Be brutally honest - A weak value proposition doesn’t get better by ignoring the issues.

### [03/05] What to Prepare Before the Meeting
#### Review key materials
*   First Value Test: Customer Meeting Guide (Ensure interviews were conducted correctly).
*   Summary of interview findings (Team members bring their notes).
*   Initial Value Proposition (Review what was tested).

#### Discussion points
*   What stood out in customer reactions?
*   What surprised you (positive or negative)?
*   What words did customers use to describe the value?
*   What concerns were raised that need addressing?

### [04/05] Meeting Agenda
#### team meeting 1
Total duration: 90 minutes

1.  **Introduction and objective of the meeting** (10 min)
    *   Recap of the first round of interviews.
    *   Reminder: We are here to learn, not defend the original idea.
    *   Review of the Fast Track Testing Approach (Patterns over opinions, Clarity over complexity, No defending weak points).
2.  **Analyzing customer reactions** (30 min)
    *   What worked well? (Key positive reactions, repeated themes).
    *   What was unclear or weak? (Hesitations, moments of confusion).
    *   What objections were raised? (Concerns that need addressing).
    *   What words did customers use? (Compare to how we describe the value proposition).
3.  **Refining the Value Proposition** (40 min)
    *   What needs clarification or simplification?
    *   What part of the message is most compelling?
    *   Are we focusing on the right pain point?
    *   Rewrite and test a revised version of the value proposition.
4.  **Next Steps and closing** (10 min)
    *   Finalize the revised value proposition.
    *   Prepare for the second round of customer meetings.
    *   Set expectations for the next review meeting.

### [05/05] final Reminders
*   Stick to real feedback - No assumptions, only evidence.
*   Avoid personal attachment - The best idea wins, not the one we started with.
*   Keep it simple - If it’s not instantly clear, it’s not working.
*   Push for action - Refine fast, test again, don’t overthink.

The best value proposition isn’t what you think sounds good - it’s what customers can’t ignore.

#### Why this matters
*   A well-tested value proposition removes guesswork - we know it works.

*   Weak spots are now fixed - we don’t tweak after this, we execute.

### [02/05] Pre-Mortem
#### Potential issues that could derail the meeting

*   Lack of commitment - This is final; we need full buy-in from the team.

#### Preventive strategies
*   Stick to the patterns - Only make changes backed by customer insights.

    *   How did customers describe the solution? (Ensure alignment with their language).
3.  **Final Refinement and locking it in** (40 min)
    *   Eliminate weak spots - Any lingering doubts need resolving.
    *   Confirm the single strongest differentiator - What makes us stand out?
    *   Ensure instant clarity - Would a new customer immediately understand?
    *   Write and agree on the final version of the value proposition.
4.  **Execution plan and closing** (10 min)
    *   Assign action items:
        *   Roll out the finalized value proposition across all departments.
        *   Update all customer-facing materials (website, sales decks, branding).
        *   Plan internal training - Everyone must communicate the value proposition consistently.
    *   Confirm full team alignment and commitment to the final version.

### [05/05] final Reminders

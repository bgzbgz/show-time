### [01/06] Tune-In Questions
(10 min)

> "Products are made in the factory, but brands are created in the mind."
> [WALTER LANDOR]

As you refine your product portfolio, remember that each product is not just a transaction, but a building block of your brand narrative in the customer's life.
*   70% of new products fail to meet revenue or market share expectations due to misalignment with customer needs.
*   Companies optimizing their product portfolios annually report a 25% higher profit margin on average.
*   The cost of misaligned product development can exceed $100 million annually for major enterprises.

**[METAPHOR]**
The Gardener’s Strategy: Consider your product portfolio as a garden where each product is a plant. Just as a gardener nurtures promising plants and prunes the withering, you must cultivate products that promise growth and trim those that drain resources without sufficient return.

### [02/06] the product strategy
Every product is merely a range of features wrapped as one. The ability to create a great product strategy boils down to:
*   Understanding the features that customers are willing to pay for
*   Creating great products around them
*   Putting all products in a portfolio that enhances the positioning of each one of them and is 100% in line with the strategy

All products are not equal – they play different strategic roles and should be designed, priced, and marketed with their specific role in mind.

1.  **Storytellers**
    Products that manifest unique features that communicate the main strategic message and promise to consumers. They create curiosity, exceed customer expectations, and serve as the backbone of a company's marketing efforts. Their position is supported by a specific pricing, packaging, distribution, and marketing strategy. On average, storytellers represent less than 10% of the portfolio. Their main role is to support strategy and marketing, and often have a minimal or even negative contribution to sales or profit.
    **[EXAMPLES]**
    *   Big Mac for McDonalds – we are best at selling burgers
    *   The M series for BMW – we are best at developing sports cars

2.  **Top line contributors**
    Products whose main purpose is to add to the TOP line – usually representing 70-80% of sales.
    They are more aggressively priced and usually represent the best value from a customer POV.

3.  **Profit contributors**
    Products that command a higher-than-average gross margin are usually built around a very competitive cost structure or unique features that other companies are unable to deliver/match. The company needs to resist the temptation to feature such products in its advertising, as this will divert customer attention away from the storytellers. This may have a positive short-term effect, but will ultimately play a negative role in the future.

#### desgining the product portfolio
The first step in designing product for each of the above categories is to list the features.

##### Decisions
*   Decide how to bundle features in different products
*   Decide the role that each product will play
*   Finalize the product portfolio

##### If you do this WELL
*   Product portfolio will become the main tool to deliver the strategy of the company
*   Products will support the marketing and branding efforts that will result in a much higher efficiency of marketing and brand spending
*   All product development activities (R&D, packaging, etc) will be clear, streamlined and more efficient
*   Sales and profit will be maximized

##### If you do NOT
*   The strategic intent and marketing messages will be blurred and contradicting for the customer
*   The company will be leaving money on the table
*   Products will fail to play the powerful strategy and marketing role that they can
*   Efficiency of sales and marketing will be lower
*   There will be internal confusion throughout the organization
*   Return on product development will be suboptimal

##### Process
*   Strategic goals: Define and align each product with our strategic market segmentation.
*   Priority setting: Identify and focus on high-potential areas based on competitive and market analysis.
*   Planning and development: Outline actionable steps for product enhancement or innovation.
*   Execution scheduling: Set clear timelines for development phases, from concept to market launch.
*   Strategic alignment: Ensure that all departmental efforts synergize to support the overarching product strategy.

##### Actionable insights
*   Simplify product features: focus on usability and customer experience to enhance product appeal and reduce complexity costs.
*   Implement a continuous feedback loop: engage customers regularly to refine products and align with evolving market needs.
*   Develop adaptive pricing strategies: craft pricing structures that reflect the perceived value and maximize market penetration.

### [03/06] F.a.q.-s
*   **What If we are selling commodities?**
    There are no commodities products, only commodities thinking. All the tools described in the previous sprints can only help companies to get out of the commodities trap.
*   **What if the company only has 2-3 products?**
    Same rules apply.
    Features analyses, price positioning and product roles should be considered as well
*   **What shall we do with all the inherited products?**
    Legacy products, often the undead dead, are the main reason for strategy confusion and low profitability, poor stock levels and cash drain. The team needs to run each of the products through the features, price map and roles test and take a decision
*   **When is the right time to discontinue products?**
    Products can play strategic role, sales role or profit role. As soon as their ability to do this is questionable, they need to be discontinued and leave space for new ones
*   **What is the best number of products?**
    There is no best number of products. The questions is what are the products we need to deliver the strategic and financial objectives.
*   **How did APPLE to it with ONE?**
    Apple phone was not ONE product – it was a hardware platform to facilitate the development and launch of a big number of products. It was just a VERY focused and straight forward way to establish an efficient channel to deliver all these software products
*   **How many features should a product have?**
    The answer needs to come from the WTP test. It is recommended that a product has ONE leading feature and some supporting ones. Pirelli P Zero tires have one leading feature – ability to carry a very high speed and some supporting ones – superior traction, light wight, low noise

### [04/06] main mistakes
*   Products come out of internal ideas only and are NOT created with the key features in mind.
*   The team develops the products FIRST and decides the price SECOND.
*   Product market fit is not tested before the launch.
*   There is no clear differentiation in features and pricing between products playing different roles.
*   Sending conflicting messages to customers by promoting and advertising products that have features that are not core for the strategy.
*   Having a “flat” portfolio – i.e. No big differentiation between product outcomes. This makes buying decisions more difficult.
*   Slow to “kill” underperforming products quickly enough.
*   Lack of consistency between all product attributes - features, packaging (yes, even services have packaging), pricing, distribution, marketing and advertising.

### [05/06] conclusion
Reaffirm the critical role of a strategically aligned product portfolio in driving sustainable business growth. This sprint is your opportunity to refine our approach, ensuring each product meets market needs and enhances our competitive stance.

Great products are engineered when product makers and market needs align perfectly.

Use this session to propel your strategic objectives forward, transforming insights into products that not only meet but anticipate market demands.

# MODULE:STRATEGY EXECUTION - SPRINT:CRAFT PRODUCT PORTFOLIO STRATEGY

## case study

### Successful product portfolio transformation in a leading FMCG company

#### [01/07] Background
A prominent Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company, facing intense competition and a saturated market, embarked on a strategic sprint using the Fast Track methodology to revitalize its product portfolio. The challenge was to innovate within their product lines to better meet changing consumer demands and enhance market share.

#### Challenge
The company's primary challenge was a misalignment between its product offerings and the evolving preferences of a younger, more health-conscious demographic. Their existing products were perceived as outdated and not in line with current wellness trends, which threatened their long-term market relevance and growth.

#### [02/07] Process

##### Sprint initiation
The company launched a sprint titled "Creating the Product Portfolio," aimed at restructuring their offerings to align with new market realities. The sprint was designed to integrate customer insights directly into product development, ensuring that each product met specific consumer needs and stood out in the competitive landscape.

##### Market analysis
The sprint began with a thorough market analysis, where the team segmented the consumer base according to their behaviors and preferences, with a focus on health-conscious consumers. This analysis revealed a significant opportunity in organic and natural products, which had not been adequately addressed by the company's current portfolio.

#### [03/07] Strategic Product Development

##### MVP Strategy
Using the Fast Track methodology, the team developed Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for a new range of organic snacks. The MVP approach allowed them to test product concepts quickly in the market without extensive upfront investment.

##### Feedback Integration
Real-time customer feedback was integrated into the development process. This was achieved through targeted focus groups and social media engagements, ensuring that the product features were fine-tuned to meet consumer expectations.

##### Feature prioritization
The team used the Fast Track feature prioritization technique, where potential product features were evaluated based on consumer willingness to pay. This ensured that only the most valued features were developed, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing product appeal.

#### [04/07] Solutions and Implementation
The team implemented a phased rollout for the new product line, starting with the most promising geographic regions based on the market analysis. Each phase included:

##### Product launches
Introducing products sequentially allowed the company to manage risks and gather continual feedback.

##### Marketing alignment
Marketing campaigns were closely aligned with the product's unique value propositions, emphasizing their organic ingredients and health benefits.

##### Cross-functional collaboration
The sprint fostered collaboration across r&d, marketing, and sales teams, ensuring that all departments were aligned with the new strategic direction.

#### [05/07] Results
The restructured product portfolio was met with enthusiastic reception from both new and existing customers. Key outcomes included:

##### Market share growth
The company experienced a 20% increase in market share within the organic product segment within the first year following its launch.

##### Brand perception
Brand perception improved significantly, with the company gaining recognition as a leader in organic and natural products.

##### Customer loyalty
Enhanced product alignment with consumer preferences led to increased customer retention and loyalty.

#### [06/07] Do’s & Don’ts
*   **✔ Do** engage directly with customers: regularly gather and integrate customer feedback throughout the product development process to ensure alignment with market needs and preferences.
*   **✔ Do** prioritize based on value: use methods like feature prioritization to focus on developing product attributes that customers are willing to pay for, ensuring efficient resource utilization and market relevance.
*   **✔ Do** test early and often: implement the minimum viable product (mvp) strategy to test product concepts in the market early in the development cycle, allowing for quick adjustments based on real-world feedback.
*   **✔ Do** foster cross-functional collaboration: ensure that teams across different departments (r&d, marketing, sales) work closely together to align on the strategic goals, facilitating a seamless and integrated approach to product launches.
*   **✔ Do** phase rollouts strategically: gradually introduce new products to the market to manage risks effectively and optimize the learning curve from each launch phase.

*   **❌ Don’t:** overlook market analysis: never skip the in-depth market segmentation and analysis phase, as understanding consumer behaviors and preferences is critical to targeting the right segments and designing compelling products.
*   **❌ Don’t:** ignore data: avoid making decisions based purely on intuition without backing them up with data from market research, consumer feedback, and performance metrics from initial product launches.
*   **❌ Don’t:** rush the development process: while speed is important, rushing through product development without thorough testing and refinement can lead to subpar products that fail to meet customer expectations.
*   **❌ Don’t:** silo departments: avoid the pitfall of operating in departmental silos where r&d, marketing, and sales do not communicate effectively, which can lead to misaligned products and marketing strategies.
*   **❌ Don’t:** neglect post-launch feedback: do not stop gathering customer feedback once the product is launched. Continuous improvement based on ongoing customer insights is crucial for maintaining and enhancing product relevance and customer satisfaction.

These dos and don'ts serve as foundational guidelines for the company's management to ensure that every product development sprint is strategically executed.

#### [07/07] conclusion
This case study exemplifies how the Fast Track methodology can effectively transform a traditional FMCG company's product portfolio to meet contemporary market demands. By focusing on consumer-driven product development, strategic feature prioritization, and agile implementation, the company not only revitalized its offerings but also positioned itself as a market leader in a growing segment.

This successful transformation highlights the importance of agility, strategic alignment, and a consumer-focused approach in sustaining a competitive advantage in the fast-paced FMCG sector.

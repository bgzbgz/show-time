### [02/05] fast track 80/20

The Dream is the essence of what you want your company to achieve in the long run. It’s simple, bold, and energizing. Unlike traditional mission or vision statements, the Dream creates a clear picture of your end goal, motivating every team member to strive toward it. A well-crafted Dream aligns the entire organization, driving focus and passion. In the Fast Track program, this Dream is the foundation upon which all strategic decisions and actions are built.

1.  The Dream is about starting with the end in mind.
    The Dream is about starting with the end in mind. It requires you to visualize where you want to be in 10 years and work backward to make it happen. This approach helps maintain clarity and focus, ensuring that all efforts contribute to the desired outcome. Starting with the end in mind simplifies decision-making and ensures that every step taken moves the organization closer to its ultimate goal.
2.  A Dream should be simple and easy to understand.
    It avoids the complexity often associated with mission or vision statements. By keeping it simple, you make it easier for everyone to embrace and act upon. Simplicity drives clarity and action. In the Fast Track program, simplicity is a core principle that ensures every member of the organization can understand and contribute to the Dream.
3.  A Dream should be bold enough to push boundaries and challenge the status quo.
    It needs to inspire your team to think big and take risks. Boldness drives innovation and growth. It ensures that the organization doesn’t settle for mediocrity but instead strives for greatness, aligning with the Fast Track principle of continuous improvement.
4.  Your Dream is a story that paints a vivid picture of the future.
    It should be a one-page narrative that everyone can visualize and get excited about. Stories resonate with people on an emotional level, making the Dream more memorable and engaging. The Fast Track program emphasizes storytelling as a powerful tool for leadership and cultural alignment.

### [03/05] Key Elements of Creating a Great Dream

Imagine telling your best friend about the incredible journey your company has been on over the past 10 years. You’re not talking about numbers or boring corporate jargon - this is about the amazing story of transformation, growth, and impact. The Dream is the heart of this story, and it’s what makes Mondays as exciting as Fridays for everyone in your organization.

The Dream isn’t just a document you file away. It’s a living, breathing part of your company’s culture. It’s the story of what you’re all working toward, the reason your team gets up in the morning, and the shared vision that everyone is excited to chase.

You start by thinking big—really big.
This isn’t about incremental goals; it’s about imagining your company at its absolute best. Where do you want to be in 10 years? What kind of impact do you want to have? What will your company look and feel like when you’ve achieved your Dream?
Picture this: Your company is known not just for its products or services but for how it’s changing the world. Your team is motivated, passionate, and aligned with the vision. Customers don’t just like your brand - they love it. And they’re telling everyone about it.

Your Dream needs to be **simple**.
Everyone in your company should understand it and feel connected to it. Complexity leads to confusion, and that’s the last thing you want. Instead, your Dream should be something that’s easy to communicate and remember - a clear, bold statement that resonates with everyone.

But simplicity doesn’t mean playing it safe.
Your Dream should be **bold**.
So bold that it pushes everyone to think beyond what’s comfortable. It’s about stretching your company’s capabilities, encouraging innovation, and setting a direction that inspires everyone to do their best work.

The best Dreams are those that are shared widely and often.
The best Dreams are those that are shared widely and often. It’s not enough to have a Dream; it needs to be communicated clearly and lived every single day. This means ensuring that the Dream is embedded in every aspect of your company’s operations, from how decisions are made to how employees interact with each other and with customers.

Your Dream should be **visual**.
Create a vivid picture in your mind of what success looks like. Imagine the excitement and energy this Dream will generate within your company. When everyone can see the end goal, it becomes much easier to work towards it.

Finally, the Dream isn’t just about what you want to achieve; it’s also about why your company exists in the first place. It’s about understanding the unique value your company brings to the world and ensuring that value is at the center of everything you do.

## GOLDEN CIRCLE
### Tool explanation and guide – FOR REVIEW ONLY

### [01/07] TOOL PREVIEW

### [02/07] Purpose

The Golden Circle tool is designed to help your leadership team uncover and articulate the core purpose of your organization. By identifying the "Why" behind your company’s existence, this tool ensures that all your actions and decisions are deeply rooted in a shared sense of purpose. This alignment is crucial for driving engagement, innovation, and long-term success.

### [03/07] Flow and Logic

1.  **Start with 'Why'**
    Begin by exploring the fundamental reason your company exists beyond making money. This step is crucial because the "Why" is what inspires people both within and outside the organization.
2.  **Define 'How'**
    Once the "Why" is clear, identify the unique processes, methods, or approaches your company uses to achieve its goals. This is where your company’s differentiation comes into play.
3.  **Clarify 'What'**
    Finally, articulate what your company actually does—the products or services you offer. This is the most tangible aspect, but should always be connected back to the "Why."
4.  **Synthesize and communicate**
    Combine the insights from the "Why," "How," and "What" to create a clear, concise statement that encapsulates your company’s purpose and strategy. This becomes a powerful tool for aligning your team and guiding your company’s direction.

### [04/07] Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Start with 'Why'**
    (20 minutes)
    Gather your leadership team and ask the following questions:
    *   Why does our company exist?
    *   What motivates us beyond profit?
    *   What impact do we want to have on the world?
    Encourage deep reflection and discussion. The "Why" should resonate on an emotional level and be something everyone feels passionately about.
2.  **Define 'How'**
    (15 minutes)
    Once the "Why" is clear, focus on how your company achieves its goals.
    Ask:
    *   What are the unique processes, values, or strategies that set us apart?
    *   How do we deliver value to our customers in a way that others don’t?
    Identify the key methods or approaches that make your company successful.
3.  **Clarify 'What'**
    (10 minutes)
    Articulate the "What" - the tangible products or services you offer.
    Ask:
    *   What exactly do we do?
    *   What are our primary products or services?
    *   How does what we do connect back to our "Why" and "How"?
    This step should be straightforward but always linked to the broader purpose and approach.
4.  **Synthesize and Communicate**
    (15 minutes)
    Combine the insights from the "Why," "How," and "What" into a single, cohesive statement.
    Ensure the statement is clear, concise, and can be easily communicated across the organization.
    **Example**
    "At our core, we exist to empower small businesses to thrive in a digital world. We achieve this by providing innovative, user-friendly software that simplifies business operations and enhances customer experiences."

### [05/07] mistakes to avoid

1.  **Starting with 'What'**
    Many companies make the mistake of starting with what they do, rather than why they do it. Always begin with the "Why" to ensure a deeper connection to your purpose.
2.  **Overcomplicating the 'Why'**
    Keep it simple and heartfelt. The "Why" should be something that everyone can understand and connect with.
3.  **Ignoring the 'How'**
    The "How" is what differentiates you from competitors. Don’t skip this step - it’s where your uniqueness lies.
4.  **Failing to communicate**
    A powerful "Why" is useless if it’s not communicated effectively. Ensure that your entire organization understands and embraces the Golden Circle.
5.  **Letting it collect dust**
    The Golden Circle should be a living, breathing part of your organization. Revisit it regularly to keep it relevant and inspiring.

### [06/07] f.a.q. and answers

1.  **Why is the 'Why' so important?**
    The "Why" gives meaning to your work and aligns your team’s efforts. It helps attract customers and employees who share your values.
2.  **How do we differentiate the 'How' from the 'What'?**
    The "How" is about the unique processes or approaches your company uses, while the "What" is the tangible product or service you offer.
3.  **Can our 'Why' change over time?**
    Yes, as long as it remains true to your core values. Revisit your "Why" periodically to ensure it still reflects your mission.
4.  **What if we struggle to define our 'Why'?**
    Start by asking why your company exists beyond making money. Consider the impact you want to have on your customers and the world.
5.  **How do we ensure our 'Why' influences our daily operations?**
    Embed the "Why" into your company culture. Use it as a filter for decisions and as a rallying cry for your team.

### [07/07] Case Study: Defining the 'Why' for a Tech Startup

**Before: The Cliché Approach**
"Our company provides cutting-edge software solutions to enhance business efficiency and drive growth."

**After: The Golden Circle Transformation**
"We exist to empower small businesses to thrive in a digital world. Our purpose is to level the playing field by providing intuitive and affordable software that simplifies operations and enhances the customer experience. We achieve this through a relentless focus on innovation and customer-centric design, offering solutions that are both powerful and easy to use. Our products are trusted by small business owners across the globe because they know we understand their challenges and are committed to their success."

## Company Dream
### Tool explanation and guide – FOR REVIEW ONLY

### [01/06] TOOL PREVIEW

### [02/06] Purpose

The Company Dream tool is designed to help your leadership team craft a vivid, bold, and inspiring Dream that reflects the future you want to create for your organization. Unlike traditional mission or vision statements, the Dream is a story - one that energizes your team, aligns their efforts, and propels your company toward a common goal. This tool guides you through the process of transforming abstract ideas into a tangible, motivating vision that everyone in your company can rally behind.

### [03/06] Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Individual reflection**
    (10-15 minutes)
    Each leader reflects on the following questions
    *   What do our customers say about us in 10 years?
    *   How do our employees feel about working here?
    *   What is our market position in Mexico and beyond?
    *   How does our workplace look and feel?
    *   What impact have we made on the community and industry?
    Write down your thoughts as vividly as possible, imagining you are living in that future.
2.  **Team discussion**
    (30 minutes)
    Gather as a team and share your individual reflections.
    Discuss the common themes and ideas that emerge.
    Identify the elements that are most inspiring and align with the company’s core values.
    Ensure the discussion remains focused on the big picture—where the company is heading, not the steps to get there.
3.  **Crafting the Dream**
    (15 minutes)
    The CEO or a designated leader synthesizes the input into a one-page narrative.
    Write the Dream in the present tense as if it’s already happening.
    The Dream should be
    *   **Simple**
        Easy to understand and communicate.
    *   **Bold**
        Ambitious and inspiring, pushing the company beyond its current boundaries.
    *   **Visual**
        Creates a vivid picture that everyone can see and feel.
    **Example**
    "In 10 years, we are the company that young, talented Mexicans aspire to join, where retail is reimagined, and where every customer experience is a celebration of innovation and cultural pride."
4.  **Validation and finalization**
    (15 minutes)
    Present the Dream to the leadership team for feedback.
    Make any necessary adjustments to ensure the Dream resonates with everyone.
    Finalize the Dream and prepare to communicate it across the organization.

### [04/06] mistakes to avoid

1.  **Vagueness**
    Creating a Dream that is too vague or generic will not inspire action or align the team. Be specific and clear in your vision.
2.  **Playing it safe**
    A Dream that is too realistic and lacks ambition won’t push the company to innovate or grow. It’s important to challenge the status quo.
3.  **Ignoring feedback**
    Focus on the core message rather than getting caught up in perfect wording. The Dream should be simple and easy to communicate.
4.  **Ignoring feedback**
    Ensure the Dream resonates with everyone by incorporating feedback from the leadership team.
5.  **Letting the Dream collect dust**
    The Dream should be a living part of your company’s culture, not just a statement that gets filed away. Revisit and communicate it regularly.

### [05/06] f.a.q. and answers

1.  **How bold should our Dream be?**
    It should push boundaries but remain believable enough to inspire action. The Dream should be ambitious, but not so far-fetched that it feels unattainable.
2.  **What if our Dream changes over time?**
    The Dream can evolve as your company grows, but it should remain a guiding light. Regularly review it to ensure it still aligns with your goals.
3.  **How do we make the Dream more than just words on paper?**
    Integrate the Dream into daily operations. Discuss it in meetings, use it as a decision-making tool, and ensure every team member understands their role in achieving it.
4.  **What if team members have conflicting visions?**
    Use the discussion to find common ground. The most compelling Dreams often combine the best ideas from different perspectives.
5.  **Can the Dream be too simple?**
    Simplicity is key. A simple, clear Dream is more likely to be understood, embraced, and acted upon by everyone in the organization.

### [06/06] Case Study: Transforming the Dream of a Retail Operator in Mexico

**Before: The Cliché Dream**
"Our vision is to be a leading retail operator in Mexico, providing unparalleled customer service and a diverse range of products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We aim to achieve sustainable growth through innovation and operational excellence, while maintaining our commitment to corporate social responsibility."

**After: The Vivid Dream Story**
"In 10 years, we will be the heartbeat of Mexico's retail revolution, a place where young, talented Mexicans come not just to work, but to create, innovate, and shape the future of retail. Our journey began with a bold vision, but what we've built is so much more than just a business; it’s a movement, a cultural phenomenon that has redefined the shopping experience across the country.

Our stores are more than places to buy products; they are vibrant community hubs where tradition meets cutting-edge technology, and where every visit is an experience to remember. Imagine walking into one of our stores: the energy is palpable, with customers of all ages exploring the latest innovations, from interactive displays that tell the story of each product to personalized shopping experiences powered by AI.

Every detail in our stores speaks of quality, craftsmanship, and a deep respect for Mexican culture. We’ve made it our mission to showcase the best of what our country has to offer - handcrafted goods, sustainable products, and innovations that are proudly 'Hecho en México.' Each product on our shelves isn't just something to buy; it’s a piece of a larger story about who we are as a company and as a nation.

But it’s not just our products that make us stand out, it’s our people. Our team comprises the brightest minds in the industry, driven by a shared passion for excellence and a desire to make a meaningful impact. They come to work each day not just to perform a job, but to push the boundaries of what’s possible in retail.

Our employees don’t just clock in and out, they are fully invested in our Dream. They are innovators, creators, and community builders who see themselves as part of something much bigger. We’ve built a culture where everyone feels valued and inspired, where ideas flow freely, and where every voice is heard. We’ve torn down the walls of traditional corporate hierarchy to create an environment where collaboration thrives and where everyone, from the newest recruit to the most seasoned executive, is encouraged to contribute their ideas.

As a company, we’ve become synonymous with trust and excellence. When customers walk into our stores, they know they’re not just getting a product, they’re getting an experience. They trust that every item they purchase has been carefully selected, ethically sourced, and thoughtfully presented. We’ve set the standard for what it means to be a responsible, innovative retailer, not just in Mexico, but across Latin America.

Our impact goes beyond the confines of our stores. We are deeply embedded in the communities we serve, contributing to local economies, supporting small businesses, and investing in sustainable practices that protect our environment. We’ve become a beacon of what’s possible when a company is committed to doing good while doing well.

And the results speak for themselves. We’ve not only captured a significant share of the market, but we’ve also captured the hearts and minds of our customers and employees alike. Our brand is a household name, not just because of our products, but because of what we stand for - innovation, quality, sustainability, and a deep love for Mexico.

Our success is reflected in the pride our employees feel, the loyalty of our customers, and the recognition we’ve received both nationally and internationally. But perhaps the most rewarding part of our journey is the knowledge that we’ve inspired a new generation of leaders and innovators in Mexico. By showing what’s possible, we’ve helped to ignite a fire of creativity and ambition in the young people who will continue to shape the future long after we’ve achieved our Dream.

In 10 years, we aren’t just a retail operator, we are the future of retail in Mexico. We are the place where dreams are made, where careers are launched, and where the future is not just imagined but built, every single day. We are more than a company - we are a movement, a community, and a force for positive change. This is our Dream, and every day, we’re making it a reality."

    Visuals make the Dream more tangible and relatable, helping to inspire and motivate the team daily.

### [06/06] Case Study: Bringing the Dream to Life for a Retail Operator in Mexico

**Before: The Uninspired Approach**
"Our vision is to be a leading retail operator in Mexico, offering a wide range of products and exceptional customer service."

**After: The Dream Visualization Transformation**
"In 10 years, we are not just a retail operator - we are the pulse of Mexico’s retail innovation. Imagine walking into our flagship store in Mexico City. The energy is electric; customers are engaged with interactive displays that blend tradition with technology. A display of handcrafted goods tells the story of Mexican artisans, while sustainable products line the shelves, all proudly 'Hecho en México.'

Every corner of the store reflects our commitment to sustainability, from the eco-friendly packaging to the solar panels on the roof. The walls are adorned with murals by local artists, celebrating Mexico’s rich culture. Our employees are more than staff, they are ambassadors of this vibrant retail experience, and their pride is palpable.

We have become the destination for young talent eager to make a difference. Our Dream Board, prominently displayed in our headquarters, is a collage of innovation, culture, and sustainability. It features images of bustling markets, cutting-edge retail technology, and influential figures such as Frida Kahlo and Steve Jobs. This board isn’t just a decoration; it’s our daily inspiration, guiding every decision and sparking creativity in every meeting."

# [MODULE:PEOPLE AND LEADERSHIP] Employer Branding AND Recruitment Strategy

## Why this sprint matters

Think of employer branding like a magnet. If it’s shaped vaguely, it attracts anyone and no one. But if it’s sharp, it pulls in the right talent—those who thrive in your culture and elevate your company.

## Striking facts

*   72% of recruiting leaders worldwide agree that employer branding has a significant impact on hiring.
*   50% of candidates say they wouldn’t work for a company with a bad reputation—even for a pay increase.
*   Companies with strong employer brands see 50% more qualified applicants and cut hiring costs by 43%.

## Key Outcomes and benefits

*   A focused, credible Employer Value Proposition (EVP).
*   Clear employee segments to target and attract.
*   Alignment between HR and leadership on what we promise—and don’t promise—as an employer.
*   Campaign concepts that turn internal strengths into external attraction.

## Consequences of not engaging fully

*   Talent mismatch and higher turnover.
*   Recruitment struggles due to unclear messaging.
*   Missed opportunity to stand out in a competitive job market.

## Sprint focus areas

### Challenges and how to overcome them

*   **Knowledge Gaps**: Teams might confuse EVP with generic values. → Clarify with examples and tools.
*   **Mindset**: Risk of overpromising. → Challenge teams to commit only to what’s consistently true.
*   **Teamwork**: HR leads alone. → Push for business-wide involvement.

### Execution challenges

*   **Inconsistent delivery of EVP across departments**. → Reinforce ownership with all hiring managers.
*   **Superficial messaging**. → Use the Anti-EVP to sharpen and differentiate.
*   **Lack of campaign focus**. → Use campaign planning tools for precision.

### Main mistakes to avoid

*   Rushing segmentation—targeting everyone = targeting no one.
*   Writing a “nice” EVP that’s not real or actionable.
*   Avoiding difficult truths in the Anti-EVP section.

## [01/06] WHY THIS MATTERS

In a highly competitive talent market, the ability to attract and retain top talent is a strategic differentiator. Just as companies create a compelling brand to attract customers, they must build a clear and authentic Employer Brand to attract the right employees.

## [02/06] What is Employer Branding?

Employer branding is the strategic process of defining, communicating, and consistently delivering a company’s value proposition to current and potential employees. It's about clearly answering: “Why would someone want to work here instead of somewhere else?”

A strong Employer Brand:
*   Attracts better-fit candidates
*   Speeds up the hiring process
*   Reduces recruitment costs
*   Improves retention and engagement

**fact**
Companies with a strong Employer Brand receive 50% more qualified applicants, make hiring decisions twice as fast, and cut the cost per hire in half.

## [03/06] The Core Concept: Employer Value Proposition (EVP)

The EVP is the centerpiece of your employer branding. It is the promise your company makes to employees in exchange for their contribution. An effective EVP is both:
*   Authentic (reflects reality)
*   Aspirational (points toward your company dream)

An EVP typically focuses on one dominant need of your target employee group. These needs typically fall into 5 categories:
*   **Compensation** (e.g. fairness, promotions, evaluation system)
*   **Benefits** (e.g. flexibility, insurance, holidays)
*   **Career** (e.g. progression, feedback, development)
*   **Work Environment** (e.g. recognition, autonomy, challenges)
*   **Culture** (e.g. leadership, team spirit, purpose, collaboration).

Key Sprint Questions
*   Who are our target employees? What are their top 5 needs?
*   What single need do we promise to fulfill better than others (our EVP)?
*   How do we translate this into a clear message and consistent recruitment strategy?

## [04/06] The process

### Part 1: Build Your Employer Brand – The Inside-Out Approach

A powerful employer brand starts from within. The core question is: “Why should a great person choose to work for us?”

This process involves:
1.  **Defining Your Target Talent Profile:**
    *   What kind of people do you want to attract? (skills, mindset, motivation)
    *   What makes them thrive in your company culture?
2.  **Internal Truths – What Makes Your Culture Great (and Honest)?**
    *   Real, lived elements of your culture and employee experience.
    *   What insiders say when recommending your workplace.
    *   Tangible strengths: e.g. growth opportunities, work-life balance, challenging work, strong leadership, etc.
3.  **What You Want to Be Known For (Positioning):**
    *   Choose 1–2 key employer brand promises that will resonate with your target talent—and are sustainable.
    *   Example: “Engineering mastery at scale” or “Real impact from day one.”
4.  **The Employer Branding Message:**
    *   Distill it into a clear message that every manager and recruiter can confidently communicate.
    *   A good employer brand message is credible, emotionally engaging, and sharp. It resonates with both the head and the heart.

### Part 2: Recruitment Strategy – Attract, Filter, Close

This is where the promise meets the process. A winning recruitment strategy delivers high-fit candidates, quickly and cost-effectively.

The key components:
1.  **Inbound Channels:**
    *   Define the best platforms and content for attracting your target talent (LinkedIn, niche job boards, events, university programs, etc.).
    *   Align messaging across job posts, career pages, and interview stages.
2.  **Outbound Strategy:**
    *   Don’t wait for talent to find you. Develop structured outbound campaigns to target passive candidates, particularly for challenging-to-fill roles.
    *   Use outreach scripts aligned with your employer brand message.
3.  **Structured Filtering Process:**
    *   Design a filtering sequence (e.g., CV screen → phone screen → assessment → structured interviews).
    *   Evaluate for both FIT (skills, motivation, mindset) and Value Alignment.
4.  **Hiring Team Readiness:**
    *   Ensure every person involved in recruitment is aligned and trained on the employer brand and process.
    *   Prepare the interview questions and scorecards that focus on what really matters.

## [05/06] Real life Example

### Industrial Equipment Manufacturer – “Magnet for Skilled Technicians and Engineers”

### Target Profile:
*   **Roles**: Maintenance engineers, production technicians, R&D specialists
*   **Mindset**: Precision-focused, process-driven, reliability-oriented
*   **Motivation**: Pride in quality, job stability, and opportunities to grow in a technically sophisticated environment

### Internal Truths (What Makes This Company Great):
*   ISO-certified facility with best-in-class machinery
*   Technicians get access to ongoing technical certifications paid by the company.
*   Very low turnover: Average tenure of technicians is 8+ years.
*   Culture of mentorship: junior staff are paired with experienced engineers.

### What They Want to Be Known For (Employer Brand Positioning):
*   “The Best Place for Technical Craftsmen Who Want Stability and Mastery”
*   “Work With the Best Machines. Learn from the Best People.”

### Employer Branding Message:
“At [Company Name], you don’t just work a job - you master your craft. With industry-leading equipment, paid certification programs, and a team of mentors, we’re where skilled technicians come to grow, stay, and thrive. Join a team that invests in your skills, respects your craft, and gives you the tools to excel.”

## [06/06] Wrapping It Up: Why This Sprint Is a Game-Changer?

Crafting a strong Employer Brand isn’t just an HR exercise - it’s a strategic business move. Your organization is only as strong as the people you can attract and retain. This sprint helps align your internal reality with the external message you send to potential candidates. It empowers you to be intentional about who you want to attract, why they should choose you, and how to turn that promise into action.

Done well, this sprint creates a lasting strategic advantage: a consistent inflow of people who are not only qualified but also aligned with your values, motivated by your purpose, and ready to grow with your company.

# [MODULE:STRATEGY EXECUTION]
## Customer Service Strategy

### Not All Customer Service Is Created Equal

Before designing or improving customer service, we must recognize a brutal fact: the same rules don’t apply to all types of businesses. The right service model is not universal — it’s strategic, segment-specific, and value-driven.

### Product vs. Service Business

Product vs. Service Business

### Objective

To design a strategic customer service system that:
*   Aligns with your behavioral segmentation and value proposition
*   Distinguishes between WOW and Just Better touchpoints
*   Elevates service from a support function to a strategic differentiator
*   Clarifies ownership, accountability, and execution metrics

### Metaphor: Service as the Final Layer of Armor

You can have the best strategy, sharp positioning, and a great product. But if the customer’s final experience is slow, inconsistent, or disconnected, you lose the battle. Customer service is your outer armor. It protects trust, reflects your values, and delivers your promise when it matters most.

### Key Outcomes

By the end of this sprint, you will:
*   Complete a customer journey map tailored to your product/service and B2B/B2C context
*   Identify and define 3 WOW touchpoints and 3 Just Better improvements
*   Link every touchpoint to the value proposition and segment pain/gain
*   Assign clear ownership, KPIs, and upgrade plans
*   Elevate the internal mindset: customer service is strategic, not reactive

### Key Sprint Guidelines

*   Anchor every decision in the behavioral segment — if the segment isn’t clear, the service won’t be.
*   Focus on how customers feel, not just what happens.
*   Do not aim for “good service” — aim for segment-specific, emotionally resonant, and strategically aligned service.
*   Push the team to distinguish clearly between:
    *   What the customer expects
    *   What we promise
    *   What we actually deliver

### Closing Challenge

You already have a customer service system — whether you designed it or not.
The question is: does it deliver your value proposition, or dilute it?

This sprint gives you the tools to align, upgrade, and lead through every customer interaction.

### INDIVIDUAL PREPARATION guide

### [01/05] Introduction

This preparation sheet is designed to get you mentally sharp, strategically aligned, and emotionally grounded before the sprint meeting. Customer service is often misunderstood as a support function. In the Fast Track system, it is strategy in action - the most visible, human expression of your value proposition.

Every service touchpoint either reinforces your brand promise or breaks it.

This sprint is about making that system intentional, segment specific, and performance driven.

“Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.” — Dwight D. Eisenhower

**Sprint’s focus**
The purpose of this sprint is to identify how customer service can become a competitive weapon across all touchpoints.

We will audit, design, and assign key service improvements using the Customer Journey Tool.

Customer service must differ depending on:
*   Whether you're B2B or B2C
*   Whether you're product - or service-based
*   The emotional and functional priorities of your specific segment

You will design systems that:
*   Reinforce the value proposition
*   Create memorable “WOW” moments
*   Consistently outperform competitors where it matters

Failure to prepare means we waste time mapping symptoms. Effective preparation ensures we rewire the service system itself.

### [02/05] Review of Last Sprint and Learnings
(10 minutes)

Reflect on how the brand and marketing work from the previous sprint should now inform service execution.

Start

### [03/05] Reading for This Week
(30 minutes)

Imagine this reading as sharpening your sword before a battle. The better you understand and internalize these concepts, the more effective you’ll be in the challenges ahead.
Before diving into the reading, consider these questions to prime your mind:

**Tune-in questions**
01. Which 3 touchpoints are currently causing the most customer friction?
02. Where do we have the most emotional leverage and are we using it?
03. What is one service moment where we could make customers feel valued, not just served?
04. Which touchpoints are inconsistent with our brand tone and segment expectations?

**preparation materials**
**Key Documents and Required Reading**
[EXPECTED TIME: 60 MIN]
*   Brain Juice: Full document, especially metaphor and Core Insights
*   Deep Dive: Frances Frei’s Uncommon Service, and summary of The Effortless Experience
*   Pre-watch (recommended): “Frances Frei – How to Build Trust” TED Talk

### [04/05] Think and Do
(60 minutes)

**think**
Reflect on the materials you will read and how they relate to your company. Consider the following:
01. Is your current service model designed for everyone or for the segment you actually want?
02. Would you trust your own system if you had to use it as a customer every week?
03. What is the most common emotional reaction your customers have after interacting with support?
04. Who owns the customer experience in your business and are they set up to win?
05. Are we measuring service efficiency or customer emotion and does that match what matters?

**Action Steps**
*   Review the latest version of your value proposition and behavioral segment profile
*   Sketch a draft customer journey from the segment’s perspective (5–8 key touchpoints)
*   Identify one moment you believe could be a “WOW” and write what needs to change, in order to make it one
*   List three touchpoints that are currently “just acceptable” but could easily be “just better”

### [05/05] Mind Rehearsal
(10 minutes)

**Agenda snapshot:**
*   Segment and value proposition recap
*   Journey mapping
*   WOW and Just Better identification
*   KPI assignment and accountability

Visualize where your voice matters most:
01. Where can you challenge vague or average service definitions?
02. Where do you need to protect the brand promise from erosion?
03. What specific moments in the customer journey can you speak to with data, observation, or experience?

Be ready to speak clearly, push hard, and drive decisions.

**final Tips**

**Set Time Aside:**
This prep needs full focus. Block 90 minutes. Think like a customer. Act like an owner.

**Apply Fast Track Principles:**
*   80/20: Focus only on the moments that shape customer memory
*   Brutal Honesty: Don’t defend legacy systems. Question everything.
*   Simplicity: If your team can't describe the service system in 10 words, it’s too complicated

**Engagement:**
You are not here to review service. You are here to rebuild it, in line with strategy, brand, and execution.

### [01/07] Tune-In Questions
(10 min)

Start

### [02/07] Customer Service Strategy

“Customer service shouldn’t just be a department. It should be the entire company.”
[TONY HSIEH, FOUNDER OF ZAPPOS]

**Why it matters:**

This sprint repositions customer service from being reactive to being strategic. It forces the entire business to design service as the execution of the brand promise - targeted to specific segments, consistent across channels, and designed around emotion, not just function.

**STRIKING FACTS**
*   96% of customers say service is critical to their brand loyalty but only 8% believe companies deliver excellent service. (Bain & Company)
*   Customers are 4x more likely to switch to a competitor due to poor service than price or product. (Zendesk, 2023)
*   Companies with emotionally connected customers see 85% higher sales growth and 306% higher lifetime value. (Harvard Business Review)
*   The Net Promoter Score (NPS) for top performers like Apple and Amazon stems not from service departments, but from entire company consistency in delivering the promised experience. (McKinsey, 2022)

**Metaphor: Service as the Final Layer of Armor**

Think of your company as a soldier built for battle. Strategy is the mission. Value proposition is the weapon. Operations are the muscles.
But customer service is the outer layer, the armor that meets the enemy face-to-face.
If your armor is weak, it doesn’t matter how good the strategy is. You will lose in contact.

This sprint strengthens that armor. Sharp, fast, emotionally strong, and segment-specific.

### [03/07] KEY CONCEPTS

1.  **Customer service is not a function - It is strategy in action**
    It is not what happens after something goes wrong.
    It is what happens every time the customer meets the company.
    Great companies engineer service touchpoints to reinforce their brand, not patch over operational gaps.

2.  **There is no universal standard**
    B2B vs B2C, product vs service - the expectations and design must change.
    Example: For B2C retail, speed and tone matter most in B2C retail, while proactivity and advice matter most in B2B consulting.

3.  **WOW vs Just better**
    Fast Track's two critical concepts:
    *   **WOW Moments:** Unexpected, emotional, memorable (e.g., Ritz-Carlton empowering staff to spend up to $2,000 to resolve guest problems instantly).
    *   **Just Better:** Places where you outperform the norm - smooth onboarding, clear returns, fast replies without necessarily being flashy.

4.  **No consistency, no trust**
    A single bad moment in the journey erases five good ones.
    Trust is built when a company delivers the same experience every time, across every channel.

5.  **Metrics that matter**
    Focus on what the customer actually remembers and talks about.
    Don’t track internal KPIs only (e.g., speed of resolution). Track customer facing outcomes:
    Did they feel cared for? Was it easy? Would they recommend us?

### [04/07] Practical Applications

1.  **Segment-Specific Service**
    Use your behavioral segment: what frustrates them, what delights them?
    Design service around that, not around averages.

2.  **Build the Customer Journey Map**
    List every touchpoint: before, during, and after the sale.
    For each: define the customer's goal, action, and thoughts.
    Then label three:
    *   **WOW:** Where will we create emotional resonance?
    *   **Just Better:** Where can we simply outperform the market?

3.  **Assign Owners and Metrics**
    Every touchpoint must have one owner.
    Set simple KPIs: response time, NPS, emotional feedback, retention.

4.  **Audit and Improve Quarterly**
    Rigorously review the journey every 90 days.
    Prioritize: one WOW upgrade, two "Just Better" fixes per quarter.

5.  **Align Internally**
    Sales, marketing, ops, support everyone must be aligned to the same promise.
    One segment, one message, one experience.

### [05/07] Application and Reflection

*   What are the top 5 moments in your current customer journey where trust is gained or lost?
*   Which touchpoint are you unintentionally outsourcing to generic standards?
*   What is one WOW moment you could create in the next 30 days?
*   What percentage of your current service team truly understands your segment’s pain?
*   Where are you currently measuring? What feels efficient to you, or what feels great to the customer?

### [06/07] Strategic Takeaways

*   You do not need to be excellent at everything - just excellent at what matters most to your customer segment.
*   Consistency beats genius. The best service feels predictable, fast, human, and emotionally safe.
*   Make customer service a leadership conversation, not a helpdesk discussion.
*   Eliminate friction at every touchpoint where emotion is high.
*   Use service moments to reinforce your positioning and promise. Every time.

### [07/07] Reflection Time
(10 min)

Start

“People will forget what you said. They will forget what you did. But they will never forget how you made them feel.”
[MAYA ANGELOU]

This sprint is not about operations. It is about memory, loyalty, and identity.
A company’s strategy is only as strong as the service moments that carry it to the customer.

## [MODULE:MASTER THE CORE ELEMENT OF PERFORMANCE - SPRINT:CUSTOMER SERVICE STRATEGY]
### DEEP DIVE
Expected reading time: 60 minutes (not included in the 90-min individual preperation)

### Top Books

#### Uncommon Service
[BOOK BY FRANCES FREI AND ANNE MORRISS]
**Fast Track ranking:** 10/10

**SUMMARY**
**Synopsis**
A brutal, clear dismantling of the myth that companies can be great at everything. Frei and Morriss argue that operational excellence is not about balance, but trade - offs. To truly excel in service, companies must choose which customers to serve, which dimensions to lead in, and which areas to be deliberately bad at. The book provides a framework for building service models that reinforce your strategic positioning and not generic customer satisfaction.

**Fast Track Top 5 Takeaways**
1.  Great service requires being bad at something else. No company can be excellent everywhere.
2.  Design your service model to reinforce your value proposition, not dilute it.
3.  Operational excellence in service is about repeatable systems, not heroics.
4.  Define your target segment clearly, then obsess over delivering what they value.
5.  Service mediocrity comes from trying to be “good for all” instead of “excellent for someone.”

#### THE EFFORTLESS EXPERIENCE
[BOOK BY MATTHEW DIXON]
**Fast Track ranking:** 9.5/10

**SUMMARY**
**Synopsis**
This book destroys the common belief that delighting customers drives loyalty. Instead, it proves with data that the strongest driver of retention is reducing customer effort. In other words, the less energy a customer has to expend, the more likely they are to return. The takeaway? Frictionless beats friendly.

**Fast Track Top 5 Takeaways**
1.  Reduce effort, not just add delight. Simplicity wins.
2.  Eliminate repeat contacts. It’s the #1 driver of dissatisfaction.
3.  Use “next issue avoidance” to anticipate customer needs.
4.  Don’t escalate everything, empower frontline teams to act.
5.  Focus on removing pain, not just adding perks.

#### THE POWER OF MOMENTS
[BOOK BY CHIP AND DAN HEATH]
**Fast Track ranking:** 8/10

**SUMMARY**
**Synopsis**
A practical guide to crafting emotionally charged moments that shape customer perception and memory. The Heath brothers show how to design peak moments that stand out, not by chance, but by choice. Think “firsts,” “lasts,” “surprises,” and “elevations.” The book is a masterclass in engineering WOW experiences that align with your brand promise.

**Fast Track Top 5 Takeaways**
1.  Memories are built on peaks, pits, and transitions.
2.  Deliberately create “signature moments” in the customer journey.
3.  Small details matter when delivered with emotional weight.
4.  Surprise drives word-of-mouth. Routine kills it.
5.  Design for emotion, not just resolution.

## [MODULE:STRATEGY EXECUTION - SPRINT:CUSTOMER SERVICE STRATEGY]
### Customer Journey Map
Tool explanation and guide – FOR REVIEW ONLY

### [01/07] Purpose

This tool helps you design a strategic customer service system by mapping the full customer experience - from initial contact to post-sale and identifying critical service moments where you can either create emotional impact or deliver superior consistency. It is aligned with your behavioral segment and value proposition.

**What you need before you start**
*   Your behavioral customer segment definition
*   Your value proposition (from previous sprint)
*   Access to the .xlsx version of the Customer Journey Tool
*   Real examples of recent customer feedback, service data, or complaints

### [02/07] The tool

### [03/07] Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Review the Segment and Promise**
    Begin with the profile of the segment you are targeting.
    Reread the brand and value proposition promise.
    This will guide which customer goals and expectations are most important.

2.  **Map the Full Journey**
    Open the spreadsheet.
    Identify 5 to 8 key customer-facing stages, such as:
    *   Awareness
    *   First contact
    *   Purchase/onboarding
    *   Usage/support
    *   Renewal/exit
    For each stage, fill in:
    *   **Customer Goal:** What are they trying to accomplish?
    *   **Customer Action:** What do they do?
    *   **Customer Thought:** What’s likely going through their mind?

    **[TIP]**
    Stay in the customer’s shoes, avoid internal language like “CRM integration” or “case opened.”

    Instead, use “I hope they respond quickly” or “I don’t know what to do.”

3.  **Identify 3 WOW Touchpoints**
    Select three points in the journey where you have the opportunity to exceed expectations.
    For each, complete:
    *   What would make this moment memorable?
    *   What emotional effect are we aiming for?
    *   What action or change is required?
    *   How will success be measured?

    **[CRITERIA]**
    A WOW moment must:
    *   Reinforce your value proposition
    *   Align with what matters most to your segment
    *   Be share-worthy, surprising, or deeply human

4.  **Identify 3 Just Better Touchpoints**
    Choose three additional points where your goal is to outperform the industry standard.
    Define:
    *   What needs to be improved?
    *   How will it be executed?
    *   Who is responsible?
    *   What metric will track it?

    **[FOCUS ON]**
    Speed, clarity, tone, simplicity, consistency

5.  **Assign Ownership and Metrics**
    For every WOW and Just Better point, assign:
    *   A responsible team or person
    *   A performance indicator (NPS, first response time, sentiment analysis, etc.)
    *   A deadline for improvement rollout

### [04/07] Do's and Don'ts

**Do**
*   Always anchor each decision in the customer segment
*   Use real service examples, not theory
*   Focus on emotion, not just process

**Don't**
*   Generalize the customer experience
*   Try to fix everything, focus on what matters most
*   Overdesign moments that don’t matter emotionally

### [05/07] Reflection and Next Steps

### [06/07] Troubleshooting and FAQs

**Q:** What if the team can’t agree on what’s a WOW moment?
**A:** Go back to the segment. Ask: “What would actually surprise or delight them?”

**Q:** We have too many touchpoints, which should we focus on?
**A:** Use the emotion filter. Choose the moments where:
    *   Trust is built or broken
    *   Memory is formed
    *   Frustration is most common

**Q:** What if we’re a mix of B2B and B2C?
**A:** Run two journey maps. Each segment needs a separate emotional design.

### [07/07] Reflection and Next Steps

*   What service moments currently contradict our brand?
*   Are we optimizing for what customers feel or what’s easiest for us?
*   Which WOW moment will we execute within 30 days?
*   How will we communicate this to frontline staff?

**After Completion**
Move immediately to execution: assign actions, set up metric tracking, and embed upgrades into team KPIs.

## [MODULE:STRATEGY EXECUTION - SPRINT:CUSTOMER SERVICE STRATEGY]
### TEAM MEETING PREPARATION GUIDE

### [01/06] Purpose of the Meeting

**Objectives**
This sprint is designed to transform customer service into a strategic execution tool, not a reactive function.
You will use the Customer Journey Tool to:
*   Map key service touchpoints across the full customer experience
*   Identify three WOW moments to create emotional impact
*   Define three Just Better improvements to outperform expectations
*   Assign ownership and KPIs for service performance
This sprint builds directly on your value proposition and behavioral segmentation.
The goal is not to improve everything, it is to improve what matters most to the right customer.

**Participation Expectations**
This is a strategy-level meeting, not a service audit. Every participant must:
*   Come with a draft journey map based on their function or customer touchpoint ownership.
*   Be prepared to challenge assumptions and defend decisions with customer insight.
*   Stay fully aligned with the segment, value proposition, and brand tone from the previous sprints.
*   Push for practical, clear, emotionally grounded execution.

### [02/06] Pre-Mortem

**Likely failure points**
*   Segment misalignment - designing for “everyone” instead of your actual segment.
*   Focusing on superficial improvements (tone, scripts) without fixing structural pain points.
*   Endless brainstorming with no decisions or prioritization.
*   Underestimating the emotional impact of inconsistency or slowness.

**Preventive actions**
*   Start with the customer segment and value proposition as anchors.
*   Use the “WOW” vs “Just Better” distinction to avoid false priorities.
*   Assign one person to write and one person to time manage.
*   If conversation drifts, ask:
    “What’s the segment pain this solves?” or “Would they feel this?”

### [03/06] Mental Rehearsal: High-Impact Participation

Before the meeting, spend 10–15 minutes doing the following mental walkthrough:

1.  **Visualize the journey**
    Walk through the customer’s experience from their first contact to post-sale
    At each stage, ask: “What are they trying to achieve?” and “What do they feel?”

2.  **Identify the gaps**
    Think of moments where friction, confusion, or emotion are highest
    Ask yourself: “If I was that customer, would I trust us here?”

3.  **Rehearse your input**
    Choose 2–3 moments where you will speak up with clarity and data
    Prepare one non-obvious insight or challenge that will drive the group forward

4.  **Practice the close**
    What will you push to get decided by the end of the sprint?
    What must happen next for execution to begin immediately?

### [04/06] What to Prepare Before the Meeting

1.  **Review the following materials**
    *   Brain Juice
    *   Deep Dive summary (focus on Frances Frei and The Effortless Experience)
    *   Your own function’s main service touchpoints

2.  **Complete**
    *   Draft a customer journey based on the behavioral segment.
    *   Highlight 3 WOW and 3 Just Better moments.
    *   Identify current service inconsistencies, and where the brand promise is being violated.

3.  **Bring to the session**
    *   Printed or editable copy of the Customer Journey Tool
    *   Examples of service success or failure from your team or customer feedback

### [05/06] Meeting Agenda

**Proposed Meeting agenda**
Total duration: 90 minutes

1.  **Introduction (10 mins)**
    Frame the difference by type (B2B/B2C and Product/Service). Align expectations.
2.  **Segment and Value Prop Re-Center (15 mins)**
    Ground in the behavioral segment and customer promise
3.  **Customer Journey Mapping (20 mins)**
    Audit all key touchpoints: before, during, after
4.  **WOW + Just Better Definition (20 mins)**
    Select top 3 in each category. Describe upgrades and assign metrics
5.  **Ownership and Execution (15 mins)**
    Confirm owners and KPIs for each upgrade
6.  **Action planning (10 mins)**
    Review next actions, 30-day execution commitment

### [06/06] Final Reminders

This sprint will only work if everyone comes prepared to think as the customer, speak as the strategist, and act as the operator. Preparation is non-negotiable.

Post-sprint, the Cult Brand promise must be reflected in every customer touchpoint.

If they feel something different than what we promised, we’ve failed.

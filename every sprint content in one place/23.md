# MODULE: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE

## CORE DECISIONS AND CAPABILITIES

### Why this sprint matters

Think of this sprint like laying down train tracks before a high-speed journey. If the tracks aren’t properly mapped and reinforced, the train can’t move at speed—or worse, it crashes. This sprint is all about identifying and strengthening the decision points and capabilities that will keep us moving fast and in the right direction.

### Striking facts

**Importance:**
Companies that clarify decision rights and match them with capabilities are 5x more likely to achieve their strategic goals.

**Pitfalls:**
Without clearly defined decision structures and capability maps, teams face 60% higher execution delays and alignment failures.

### Key Outcomes and benefits

*   **Sharper Decision-Making:** We’ll identify the most critical decisions within our core activities and and who owns them.
*   **Capability Mapping:** We'll define what competencies are truly required to execute at a high level - internally or externally.
*   **Clearer Development Priorities:** Gaps in current capability will be flagged for focused improvement or support.

### Consequences of not engaging fully

*   **Blurred Ownership:** Unclear responsibilities can stall execution or lead to poor decisions.
*   **Stalled Performance:** Capabilities that are not defined or developed will cause critical activities to underperform.
*   **Reduced Team Effectiveness:** Teams may spend more time reacting than leading proactively.

### Sprint focus areas

#### Challenges and how to overcome them

*   **Knowledge:** Review the core activities and their current owners beforehand to make more targeted contributions.
*   **Mindset:** Stay curious—what worked in the past might not be enough for the next stage.
*   **Teamwork:** Respect different functional lenses—marketing’s needs may differ from operations, but alignment matters.

#### Execution challenges

*   **Linking Decisions to Data:** Not all teams are used to thinking this way—support them with real examples.
*   **Capability Ownership:** Clarify what’s internal, and what might need external help or development.
*   **Avoiding Overcomplication:** Focus on the critical few—not everything needs to be a “core decision.”

#### Main mistakes to avoid

*   **Treating Everything as a Core Decision:** Focus only on what truly moves the needle.
*   **Ignoring Capability Gaps:** Don’t assume current strength = sufficient strength.
*   **Being Vague About KPIs:** Be specific—"increase sales" isn’t a KPI; "Lead conversion rate" is.

### [01/06] Tune-In Questions
(10 min)

### [02/06] Sprint Objective

After this sprint, you’ll have:
*   A clear map of decisions that move the needle
*   A small set of real KPIs that drive focus
*   A crisp picture of what capabilities matter and where the gaps are
*   A foundation for PDPs, hiring, and performance reviews
This is how you stop working harder and start working smarter.

### [03/06] Fast Track 80-20

1.  **Every Core Activity Depends on Critical Decisions**
    In Fast Track, we break complexity into clarity. Each core activity needs its own decision structure—no decision, no execution. Without defining who decides, what’s decided, and how often, your teams will bottleneck.
2.  **You Can’t Improve What You Don’t Measure**
    Once decisions are in place, KPIs turn activities from guesswork into performance machines. Three sharp KPIs per core process will let you track, adapt, and scale. This isn’t reporting. This is operational control.
3.  **Clear Inputs Create Strong Decisions**
    Great decisions require relevant data. Each process must be linked to data inputs that fuel smarter choices. Bad data = bad calls.
4.  **Capabilities Drive the Execution**
    You can’t just decide. You need to build the muscle. Every core process requires capabilities to support it, including skills, tools, systems, and workflows. No capability? Then it’s just theory.
5.  **The Real Power Is in Focus**
    Don’t try to manage everything. Focus only on the top processes—the ones that directly impact your value proposition. Fast Track is about choosing where to win, not spreading thin.

### [04/06] Why Defining Core PROCESSES, DECISIONS Matters

#### What this sprint is really about

You’ve already defined your core activities - the few essential things your business must execute brilliantly to deliver its value proposition. That was Sprint 1.

But strategy without execution is just a dream.

This sprint is about turning those activities into something operational, measurable, and manageable. You’ll do that by:
*   Clarifying the key decisions that drive performance.
*   Identifying the KPIs to measure outcomes and performance quality.
*   Specifying the capabilities each team (and person) needs to deliver those results, repeatedly and at speed.
Together, these three pieces - decisions, KPIs, and capabilities - form the real engine room of your company. This is what makes your org structure functional, not just theoretical.

#### Why most companies get stuck

Too many companies operate in a fog.

No one’s clear on who decides what. Information is scattered. Decision rights are vague. As a result, everything slows down. Alignment drops. People escalate decisions unnecessarily—or worse, avoid them altogether.

#### The Fast Track fix?

*   Clarify which decisions matter most.
*   Equip the right people to make them fast.
*   Back every decision with data, ownership, and skill.
This sprint isn’t about creating another document. It’s about giving your team the keys to move faster and act smarter - without waiting for approvals or playing internal politics.

#### Step 1: Identify the core decisions

For each core activity, ask: what are the 3–5 key decisions that determine success?

These aren’t just random choices - they’re high-impact, recurring, and influence core KPIs. They often live in the grey zone between strategy and operations.

Think of decisions as the heartbeat of execution. If a decision is unclear, slow, or stuck at the wrong level, the whole system gets blocked.

**How to spot core decisions:**
*   They’re made often (weekly, monthly).
*   They directly affect business outcomes.
*   They need data - not just opinions.
*   When they go wrong, the impact is visible.

**EXAMPLES**

**Zara**
**Core Activity:** Fast Fashion Design
*   Which trend-based items should we greenlight this week?
*   How many SKUs should we release, and in which regions?
*   What gets pulled from stores and when?

**Company X – Nursing Education**
**Core Activity:** Course Development
*   Which new healthcare trends must be reflected in our content?
*   What’s the right balance of theory vs. practice?
*   Which employers do we co-design programs with?
Clarity here is power. These are not tasks—they’re leverage points.

#### Step 2: Define the data and KPIs

Every decision needs feedback. If people don’t know whether a decision worked, they can’t improve. That’s where data comes in.

You need two types of input:
*   **Decision data** – available before or during decision-making (e.g., real-time sales data, application rates, inventory levels).
*   **Outcome KPIs** – metrics that measure whether the decision drove the desired result.

**EXAMPLES**

**Zara – Design Activity KPIs:**
*   Time from sketch to shelf (speed)
*   SKU success rate (hit ratio)
*   Weekly trend adoption rate (customer alignment)

**Company X – Course Dev KPIs:**
*   % of courses updated annually (relevance)
*   Employer satisfaction scores (market fit)
*   Number of new programs launched (innovation pace)
These KPIs are your performance signals. They tell you if you’re building momentum or wasting cycles.

#### Step 3: Define the capabilities

Now ask: What do we need to be great at to do this well, every time?

This is where most organizations fall short. They design the activity, but don’t build the muscle to execute it.
That’s what capabilities are: the real-world skills, systems, and resources needed to win.

Think of capabilities as the engine behind your org chart. No capability = no delivery.

**Capabilities may be:**
*   **Human** – skills, expertise, experience
*   **Systemic** – tools, platforms, workflows
*   **Relational** – partnerships, collaboration patterns

**EXAMPLES**

**Zara – Capabilities for Design Activity:**
*   Designers and buyers in daily sync, making real-time calls
*   Rapid prototyping labs
*   Tight feedback loops from stores and data systems

**Company X – Capabilities for Course Dev:**
*   Curriculum designers who understand regulation + pedagogy
*   Direct input from industry partners
*   Fast, modular content production systems
You can’t outsource this. If you lack the capability, build it, buy it, or partner for it.

#### Use the capability gap for PDPs

Here’s the payoff.
Once you define the capabilities for each core activity, compare them to the current team’s skills and systems.

The difference between the two? That’s the development gap.

That gap becomes your:
*   Training agenda
*   Hiring spec
*   Partner search criteria
*   Personal Development Plans (PDPs)
It’s not about blaming people. It’s about designing success into the role.

If someone doesn’t have the capability today, that’s fine—as long as there’s a plan to close the gap.

#### Final word – Build the machine, not just the team

Don’t confuse having smart people with having a high-performing structure.

Smart people slow down in broken systems.
Average people speed up in well-designed systems.

This sprint helps you build that system - one core activity at a time.
Get the decisions clear. Make the data visible. Build the capability.
This is the real work of scaling.

# MODULE: PEOPLE AND LEADERSHIP

## Set Agile Teams

### Why This Sprint Matters

Think of this sprint as tuning a high-performance engine. Unless each component is aligned and firing in sync, you’ll never reach top speed. “Set Agile Teams” sharpens our organizational engine so we can accelerate without stalling.

### Striking Facts

*   **Faster Decisions:** Teams will make and act on decisions in days, not weeks.
*   **Lean Processes:** Eliminate bottlenecks and reduce “waiting time” by embedding cross-functional expertise.
*   **Aligned Teams:** Everyone shares a clear mission, boundaries, and metrics—so the squad moves as one.

### Consequences of Not Engaging Fully

*   Key decisions required for each core activity
*   Capabilities needed to execute decisions effectively
*   Gap analysis between current and required capabilities
*   Data requirements for decision-making

### Sprint Focus Areas

### Fast Track Tools to Be Used

*   Impact/Ease Matrix (Excel tool)
*   Agile Team Charter Template (Excel tool)
*   One-Page Dashboard for sprint reviews

### Challenges and How to Overcome Them

*   **Knowledge:** Not everyone is familiar with agile outside software—share a 5-minute primer on core concepts at the start.
*   **Mindset:** Some resist decentralized authority—emphasize clear boundaries and accountability to build trust.
*   **Teamwork:** Cross-functional squads can clash—use a neutral facilitator to keep discussions on track.

#### Execution Challenges

*   Sustaining Rhythm: Two-week sprints require discipline—lock in standing calendar invites immediately.
*   Support Delays: Back-office groups may default to old SLAs—pre-agree simplified 48-hour turnarounds for critical requests.

### Main Mistakes to Avoid

*   Over-scoping the Mission: One squad, one mission—avoid bundling multiple objectives.
*   Incomplete Charters: Skipping budget or KPI definitions leads to drift—fill every field in the template.
*   Neglecting Review Cadence: Without weekly check-ins, learning stalls—commit to a fixed review slot.

### Introduction

#### Why This Sprint Matters

Welcome to the “Set Agile Teams” sprint. Your leadership in establishing rapid-response squads will directly enhance your ability to seize opportunities and address critical challenges. By investing 90 focused minutes now, you’ll ensure the team kicks off with clarity and momentum. Without this preparation, we risk repeating the delays and misalignments that slow us down.

#### Practical Benefits

Mastering this sprint will enable you to:

*   Enhance your strategic thinking by framing problems through an impact/ease lens.
*   Improve decision-making with tools you’ll apply immediately (Impact/Ease Matrix, Team Charter).
*   Strengthen team dynamics by arriving ready to co-create high-velocity squads.

#### Possible Dangers of Not Tackling It Well

Failing to prioritize this sprint could lead to:

*   Misaligned priorities that dilute team focus.
*   Less effective contributions in our charter workshop.
*   Missed opportunities to embed agile ways of working.

### Tune-In Questions **(10 min)**

**Start**

**[02/04]**

### The Killers of Speed

In most organizations, up to 80 percent of project time is consumed not by doing work, but by waiting on approvals, budgets, legal sign-offs, resource allocations, and planning cycles. Three core drivers starve your teams of momentum:

1.  **The Illusion of Control**
    Annual planning is a months-long effort to predict the unpredictable. Teams spend 3–4 months drafting a detailed 12-month plan, only to watch market conditions shift before the ink is dry.
    As a result, your organization focuses on “making the plan” (and pleasing the boss) rather than solving real problems and delighting customers.
2.  **Endless Waiting**
    Frontline teams sit idle while waiting for budgets, headcount, or legal review, and are then “shoe-horned” into other work to fill the gap.
    This constant context switching increases delays, reduces quality, and destroys morale.
3.  **Sequential Decision Chains**
    The typical decision process flows in six steps:
    1.  Gather information
    2.  Generate ideas
    3.  Experiment (test & learn)
    4.  Make a decision
    5.  Allocate resources
    6.  Implement
    In a hierarchy, each handoff - from frontline staff to supervisor to manager to executive - adds days or weeks of delay, by which time the original insight is outdated.

**Bottom Line:**
Rigid hierarchies, annual budgeting, and siloed approvals are “speed killers.” To compete in fast-changing markets, you must overcome these bottlenecks and put decision-making power where the work actually happens.

### Why Agile Teams Matter

Traditional hierarchies and long approval chains kill speed and focus. An Agile Team is a small, cross-functional squad empowered to:

*   Spot the biggest bottleneck or opportunity
*   Prioritize by impact and feasibility
*   Define clear goals, rules, structure, and success metrics
*   Execute fast experiments and learn in weeks, not months

**[03/04]**

### The 3-step method that cuts through red tape and drives you straight to results

**Step 1: Brainstorm Problems & Opportunities**
**Goal:** Surface everything slowing you down or holding untapped potential.

*   List all organizational pain-points and growth ideas (e.g., “Slow customer onboarding,” “High return rates,” “Untested new market”).
*   Capture them in your template’s Column D

**Step 2: Prioritize with an Impact/Ease Matrix**
**Goal:** Zero in on the 2–3 initiatives that will move the needle fastest.

*   For each item, assign:
    *   Impact (1–3): How big a difference will solving this make?
    *   Ease (1–3): How quickly and cheaply can you tackle it?
*   Score = Impact + Ease.
*   Select the top 3 highest-scoring items.

**Step 3: Define Goal, Rules, Team & KPIs**
For each of your Top 3 initiatives, fill out

*   Project End-Game: Be laser-specific—state the exact metric change and timeline.
*   Playing-Field Rules: Define budget, decision rights, geographic or scope limits.
*   Agile Team Structure: Pick 4–6 roles—tailored to the challenge (no handoffs!).
*   KPIs: 2–4 metrics that track both output (what you do) and outcome (what it delivers).

**Example:**

**[04/04]**

### Next Steps & Best Practices

*   Kick off each squad with a 1-hour sprint-zero: align on mission, rules, and KPIs.
*   Run 2-week iterations: build a minimal test → measure results → adjust or scale.
*   Report weekly to stakeholders with a 1-page dashboard - keep it simple.
*   Rotate or disband teams once the goal is met; apply the same method to your next priority.

**Fast Track Reminder:**
Treat each Agile Team like a micro-startup - focus on one bold mission, move quickly, learn daily, and then scale the winners.

# MODULE: STRATEGY EXECUTION

## Route to Market Strategy

### Products

#### Objective

*   **Strategic Fit:** Select an RTM fully aligned with your target segment and value proposition—not based on habit, ease, or volume alone.
*   **Clarity and Focus:** Evaluate all realistic RTM options and eliminate those that do not strengthen your positioning.
*   **Execution Alignment:** Identify the internal systems, people, and partnerships needed to execute the selected route at scale.
*   **Avoid Dilution:** Prevent fragmentation of channels, brand experience, or pricing through over-complex or inconsistent RTM mixes.

#### What Makes This Sprint Different

*   RTM is not just a sales or distribution choice—it is the execution of your brand strategy.
*   We work backwards from the value proposition and target customer—not forward from operations.
*   We prioritize focus over optionality: 1–2 lead RTMs that you can dominate, not 5+ that dilute your power.
*   We treat RTM as a core strategic decision, requiring inputs from product, marketing, finance, ops, and leadership.

#### Pre-Sprint Preparation Required

*   A clear view of the target customer segment and the final value proposition.
*   A list of all realistic RTM options, with rough notes on reach, margin, control, and brand consistency for each.
*   Any available margin/cost data, segment research, or customer channel preferences.
*   Completion of the Team Preparation Template and review of the RTM Brain Juice and Deep Dive Summary.

#### Sprint flow and agenda

1.  **Kickoff (10 min)**
    Sprint leader restates strategy: segment, VP, brand promise. Confirms that RTM = execution of brand.
2.  **Option Mapping (15 min)**
    List and describe each RTM option. Group as Direct, Retail, Partner, or Hybrid.
3.  **VP–RTM Fit Test (20 min)**
    Run each option through 5-question Fit Filter. Eliminate poor fits. Score and debate top 3.
4.  **Scenario Testing (20 mins)**
    Model top 2–3 RTMs. What capabilities, people, tools, and investment do they require? What would launch look like in 90 days?
5.  **Final Decision (15 min)**
    Choose 1–2 lead RTMs. Align team on the why, and document what success looks like.
6.  **Wrap-Up (10 min)**
    Confirm execution next steps. Assign ownership. Book follow-up checkpoint (2–4 weeks).

#### Key Tools You Will Use

*   **RTM Fit Filter** (Does it deliver the promise? Reach the customer? Protect margin? Scale? Fit our ops?)
*   **Fast Track Deep Dive Summary** (Best books, articles, videos)
*   **RTM Execution Map** (Used in scenario testing: what must be true for this RTM to succeed?)
*   **Post-Sprint Implementation Planner** (For team leads to begin action immediately)

#### Output of the Sprint

By the end of the session, the team will have:

*   Chosen 1–2 lead RTMs based on strategic fit—not personal preference or volume.
*   Defined what is needed to execute the chosen RTM successfully (resources, team, tooling).
*   Aligned all stakeholders around the decision and next 90-day steps.
*   Eliminated channels that dilute brand, fragment focus, or erode margin.

# MODULE: STRATEGY EXECUTION - SPRINT: ROUTE TO MARKET STRATEGY - PRODUCTS

## brain juice

### [01/08]

#### Tune-In Questions

** (10 min)**

---

### [01/09]

#### Sprint Objective

*   To define the optimal Route to Market (RTM) for a product-based business, in a way that is 100% aligned with its value proposition, target segment, and brand positioning.
*   To ensure RTM becomes a strategic execution mechanism and not a sales/distribution afterthought.
*   To ensure every team member can logically connect the chosen RTM to the product’s core promise and customer expectations.

### [02/09]

#### KEY CONCEPTS

1.  **RTM is Strategy in Action**
    *   Route to Market is the engine that turns your strategy into results.
    *   It determines how your product reaches the customer, in what format, through which channels, and under what brand experience.
    *   Bad RTM = failed execution, even with a good product and strong value proposition
2.  **RTM Must Reflect the Strategy**
    *   RTM depends on three key inputs:
        1.  **Target Segment** – Who are we building for?
        2.  **Value Proposition** – What specific problem are we solving?
        3.  **Brand Promise** – What experience are we committing to deliver?
    *   Your RTM must deliver that value proposition with clarity and consistency to the exact person you’ve targeted.
3.  **Choosing RTM is Choosing Trade-Offs**
    *   Every RTM option implies trade-offs in:
        *   **Control** (Do you own the customer experience?)
        *   **Speed** (How fast can you scale?)
        *   **Margin** (What % do you keep?)
        *   **Brand Experience** (Does the channel reinforce or dilute it?)
        *   **Operational Complexity** (Do you have the capabilities to deliver?)
    *   You cannot optimize for everything. You must choose.
4.  **Product RTMs Have Unique Needs**
    *   Physical products often involve multiple moving parts: inventory, shipping, packaging, shelf placement, etc.
    *   Choosing a product RTM also means choosing which systems, partners, and cost structures you will build your growth on.

### [03/09]

#### Why It Matters

Your RTM is the first place customers experience your value proposition in action.
**A great RTM:**

*   Delivers your product with the right timing, trust, and tone.
*   Maximizes margin by matching investment to value.
*   Scales efficiently by aligning resources with actual buying behavior.
**A poor RTM:**

*   Confuses your audience.
*   Drains resources with low-margin partners or channels.
*   Weakens your brand.

### [04/09]

#### common mistakes

*   Starting with a channel, not a strategy – e.g., “let’s launch retail” without aligning with the target segment or VP.
*   Following the competition blindly – your strengths, promise, and product may require a different route.
*   Overcomplicating the channel mix – too many channels creates confusion and dilutes execution.
*   Underestimating margin leakage – distributors, retailers, and marketplaces each take a slice.
*   Ignoring operational readiness – you can’t pick D2C if you can’t fulfill e-commerce orders reliably.

### [05/09]

#### Concrete Examples

1.  **Example 1: Premium Functional Beverages**
    *   **VP:** “Daily hydration meets mental clarity – a nootropic drink you feel in 10 minutes.”
    *   **Target:** Urban professionals aged 25–40, digitally savvy, brand-sensitive.
    *   **RTM Chosen:** D2C + premium coworking cafés + boutique gyms.
    *   **Why It Works:** High control, fits the brand’s premium feel, delivers the promise in trusted contexts.
2.  **Example 2: Affordable Sports Nutrition Line**
    *   **VP:** “Clean protein you can trust – accessible to every athlete.”
    *   **Target:** Budget-conscious Gen Z and young adults.
    *   **RTM Chosen:** Mass e-commerce platforms + discount retailers.
    *   **Why It Works:** High visibility and low-friction purchase for a cost-sensitive audience.

### [06/09]

#### Fast Track Framework: “VP–RTM Fit Filter”

For each channel option, test the following:

| Criteria                               | Yes | No |
| :------------------------------------- | :-- | :- |
| 1. Does it deliver our brand promise?  |     |    |
| 2. Does it reach our target customer?  |     |    |
| 3. Does it protect our margin?          |     |    |
| 4. Can we scale it efficiently?        |     |    |
| 5. Does it fit our operational reality? |     |    |

Only channels that score 4 or 5 Yes should be considered as core RTMs.

### [07/09]

#### Next Steps and Actions

1.  Review your Strategy Inputs
    Confirm your Value Proposition, Target Segment, and Brand Positioning.
2.  List RTM Options
    Direct (D2C), retail, e-commerce, distribution partners, marketplaces, subscription, etc.
3.  Use the RTM Filter
    Run each channel through the VP–RTM Fit Filter.
4.  Choose 1–2 Primary RTMs
    Focus matters. Pick the ones that best amplify your brand promise and maximize profit.
5.  Identify Gaps
    For your chosen RTM, list the execution systems or partnerships you’ll need to win (e.g., logistics, CRM, packaging, team roles).
6.  Define Next Milestones
    What does success look like at 3 months? At 12 months? Build a sprint plan backward from those goals

### [08/09]

#### conclusion

Your product does not sell itself. Your Route to Market is what turns a good strategy into revenue, scale, and loyalty.

Always start with your customer and your promise - and work forward from there. Never the other way around.
Get the RTM right, and the rest becomes easier. Get it wrong, and nothing else will fix it.

This Brain Juice is your foundation for the RTM Sprint. Use it to lead with clarity, align the team, and make decisions that turn your strategy into sales.

### Top Books

#### A Field Guide to Channel Strategy

**[BOOK BY ANNE T. COUGHLAN & SANDY D. JAP]**
**Fast Track ranking: 9/10**

##### SUMMARY

##### Fast Track Synopsis

This book provides a rigorous, real-world framework for designing and executing high-performing routes to market.

It begins by asking the only question that matters:
        **What does your customer need from the channel to trust and buy?**

The authors help you analyze which routes (direct, retail, third-party, etc.) deliver your value proposition with consistency and profitability.

They dissect real trade-offs:
         **Cost vs. control, reach vs. trust, scale vs. brand coherence.**

The book explains how to structure partner relationships, handle channel conflict, and define clear performance metrics. It stresses that channel decisions are strategy, not logistics.

Coughlan and Jap also emphasize that no channel works forever. You must adapt as the business evolves.

They provide blueprints for evaluating whether to go direct or through partners, and how to avoid being trapped in outdated models.

Practical and grounded, the book is ideal for Fast Track teams looking to scale without brand dilution. Its logic-first, trade-off-aware approach perfectly supports the Fast Track RTM framework

##### Top 3 Fast Track Applications AND How to Use Them

1.  **Channel Design Framework**
    *   **Outcome:** A ranked shortlist of channels with strategic justification.
    *   **How to Use:** In your RTM sprint, lay out all viable channels, then test each against the Fast Track VP–RTM Fit Filter (reach, margin, control, brand consistency).
    *   **Outcome:** A ranked shortlist of channels with strategic justification.
2.  **Conflict Navigation Toolkit**
    *   **What:** Tools to manage dual-channel friction (e.g., direct vs. retail).
    *   **How to Use:** Use in post-sprint alignment to preemptively identify where your channels may clash and develop governance rules.
    *   **Outcome:** Clear roles and conflict prevention between internal teams or external partners.
3.  **Channel Performance Metrics**
    *   **What:** Measurable indicators of channel health (e.g., margin contribution, churn rate, partner NPS).
    *   **How to Use:** Include these in your RTM sprint wrap-up as part of your ongoing monitoring system.
    *   **Outcome:** RTM decisions are continuously optimized and not set once and forgotten.

#### Go-To-Market Strategist

**[BOOK BY MAJA VOJE]**
**Fast Track ranking: 9/10**

##### SUMMARY

##### Fast Track Synopsis

This book is a GTM playbook for the modern strategist, built around first-hand insights from over 50 entrepreneurs and marketers.

It frames go-to-market not as a campaign, but as an iterative system aligned with real customer behavior.

Maja Voje argues that success depends on sequencing:
         **Product clarity, audience insight, and channel fit. Then layering them into growth systems.**

She insists that RTM cannot be built without product market fit, and provides frameworks to validate channels fast.

The book is filled with post-MVP startup war stories, showing how B2C and B2B companies adjusted their channels after launch based on conversion friction or margin loss.

Voje also explains how to scale RTM through automation, brand leverage, and hybrid models.

For Fast Track, this book reinforces the idea that RTM is inseparable from customer segmentation and product design.

Her agile, lean approach aligns closely with our sprint logic and 80/20 testing.

It's less theoretical than Coughlan & Jap, but highly complementary.

##### Top 3 Fast Track Applications AND How to Use Them

1.  **Customer-Led RTM Testing**
    *   **What:** Use lean tests to validate channels with actual users before rollout.
    *   **How to Use:** During the RTM sprint, design one-week test pilots per channel with minimal cost (e.g., D2C via landing page + product sample).
    *   **Outcome:** Choose RTM based on conversion data, not assumptions.
2.  **Segment-Specific Channel Matching**
    *   **What:** Channel fit must reflect the buying behavior of your priority segments.
    *   **How to Use:** Use segment personas to build RTM maps: where do they expect to find you? How do they buy? Match channel to buyer habits.
    *   **Outcome:** Lower CAC, higher conversion from day one.
3.  **RTM Layering Roadmap**
    *   **What:** Start narrow, then scale with automation, partnerships, or tiered distribution.
    *   **How to Use:** Build a 3-stage RTM rollout in the sprint (Phase 1: D2C test; Phase 2: curated retail; Phase 3: national scale).
    *   **Outcome:** Less upfront risk; execution aligned to traction.

#### Crossing the Chasm

**[BOOK BY GEOFFREY MOORE]**
**Fast Track ranking: 8/10**

##### SUMMARY

##### Fast Track Synopsis

Moore’s classic explains why many innovations fail to move beyond early adopters and how RTM plays a key role in breaking through to the mainstream.

He introduces the “chasm” between visionary users and pragmatic buyers, and shows that companies must change how and where they sell to cross it.

The core message is that one-size-fits-all RTM doesn’t work. What sells to early believers won’t work for the masses.

Moore emphasizes “whole product thinking", meaning your RTM must bundle education, support, delivery, and proof, not just the SKU.

He shows how niche beachhead markets provide the traction needed to scale smartly.

For Fast Track, this book is highly relevant when your product has clear innovation, novelty, or complexity.

It reminds us that RTM must change as your market matures, and that you must sequence channels as carefully as you design your product. It’s ideal for scale-stage sprints or category-creating launches.

##### Top 3 Fast Track Applications AND How to Use Them

1.  **Beachhead Channel Focus**
    *   **What:** Start with one channel that dominates a small, high-need segment.
    *   **How to Use:** Choose RTM that resonates strongest with your first 1,000 customers—even if it won’t scale long-term.
    *   **Outcome:** Fast traction, word-of-mouth, early margin.
2.  **Whole-Product RTM Packaging**
    *   **What:** RTM must deliver the full experience, not just the product.
    *   **How to Use:** Bundle onboarding, education, and support directly into RTM plans (e.g., if D2C, use an onboarding email series + live chat).
    *   **Outcome:** Less churn, more trust, faster loyalty loop
3.  **Chasm-Aware Sequencing**
    *   **What:** Different buyer personas need different RTMs.
    *   **How to Use:** Build two-stage RTM: one for early adopters, one for pragmatists. Identify the trigger to switch.
    *   **Outcome:** Your RTM evolves with market readiness, not static.

**Tool explanation and guide – FOR REVIEW ONLY**

### [01/05]

#### Purpose

This tool helps the team:

*   Visually map and compare all realistic RTM options (offline and online)
*   Break down each route into sequential execution steps
*   Link every RTM back to the end consumer and brand promise
*   Align distribution decisions with strategic priorities—not just operational reach

### [02/05]

#### When to Use

Use the tool during the Scenario Testing and Final Decision phases of your RTM Sprint:

*   After you’ve scored and filtered your RTM options using the RTM Fit Filter
*   Before committing to 1–2 lead routes that will be piloted or scaled

### [03/05]

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  Populate Realistic RTM Routes
    *   Start with the “COMPANY” cell (row 9, column C).
    *   For each RTM being considered, map it horizontally, 1 row per route:
        *   Fill in Step 1 through Step 4 with the actual entities (e.g., Regional Distributor, Large Retail Chain, Online Marketplace).
        *   If your RTM is shorter or longer, leave unused steps blank or add cells.
        *   Use arrows to show flow clearly toward the consumer.
2.  Mark Channel Type
    *   In column I (“Offline Channels”) or column J (“Online Channels”), tick or label the type of route.
    *   Helps track whether the RTM is being built around physical presence, digital funnel, or hybrid logic.
3.  Validate Strategic Fit
    *   Next to each route, assess:
        *   Does it deliver our value proposition?
        *   Is it consistent with our price, margin, and brand promise?
        *   Do we have (or can we build) the capabilities to execute this route?
4.  Link Back to End Consumer
    *   Ensure that all arrows and flows end at the “END CONSUMER” node.
    *   Confirm that from Step 1 through Step 4, nothing breaks trust, margin, or clarity.

### [04/05]

#### Sample Use Case

1.  **RTM: D2C via Branded Website**
    *   **Step 1:** COMPANY
    *   **Step 2:** Own Warehouse

    *   **Step 4:** Customer Home
    *   **Channel Type:** Online
    *   **Outcome:** Maximum control, strong brand, limited retail exposure
2.  **RTM: Mass Retail via Distributor**
    *   **Step 1:** COMPANY
    *   **Step 2:** National Distributor
    *   **Step 3:** Retail Chain (e.g., Carrefour)
    *   **Step 4:** In-Store Buyer
    *   **Channel Type:** Offline
    *   **Outcome:** High reach, lower margin, less brand control

### [05/05]

#### final review before decision

After all candidate routes are mapped:

*   Highlight the top 1–2 RTMs the team believes in
*   Identify gaps: what partnerships, tools, or resources are needed?
*   Transfer the selected routes into the Sprint Wrap-Up or Execution Plan

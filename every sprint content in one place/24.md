# MODULE: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE - SPRINT: FIT and ABC Analysis

## Why this sprint matters

Think of your organization as a sports team. Even the best strategy won’t win championships if the wrong players are on the field or playing in the wrong positions. This sprint is about making sure the right people are doing the right things—so your strategy can truly perform.

### Striking facts

*   Misaligned talent can reduce team effectiveness by over 30%.
*   High performers in the right roles deliver up to 400% more than average ones.
*   Yet, 1 in 3 leaders avoid addressing people-fit issues until it's too late.

### Key Outcomes and benefits

*   Clarity on which team members are true value creators
*   Confidence in who’s a long-term fit (and who may not be)
*   Targeted development and retention strategies
*   Stronger team alignment and accountability

### Consequences of not engaging fully

*   Retaining low-performers damages culture and productivity
*   Misplaced loyalty leads to missed performance goals
*   Poor FIT leads to burnout and unmotivated teams

## Sprint focus areas

### Challenges and how to overcome them

*   **Knowledge:** Use the Brain Juice to clearly grasp the FIT/ABC concepts.
*   **Mindset:** Be brutally honest, not sentimental. The goal is performance, not comfort.
*   **Teamwork:** Encourage trust—this is a sensitive conversation, but a necessary one.

### Execution challenges

*   Reluctance to make hard calls
*   Over-protectiveness of “good but not great” performers
*   Delayed follow-up on tough feedback

**Solution:**
Ground every decision in role fit, contribution, and the future of the company—not the past.

### Main mistakes to avoid

*   Confusing personality with performance
*   Overrating B players out of fear of losing them
*   Skipping development conversations post-sprint

# MODULE: STRATEGY EXECUTION - SPRINT: FIT & ABC ANALYSIS

## INDIVIDUAL PREPARATION guide

### [01/05] Introduction

This sprint will challenge you to step into one of the most strategic parts of leadership: evaluating people with clarity and courage. It’s about more than performance—it’s about FIT.
We’ll use two complementary frameworks:

*   **FIT Analysis:** Are people naturally energized and suited for the role they are in?
*   **ABC Analysis:** Are they delivering results and behaving in line with company values?

As CEO – your task is to evaluate the executive team.
As an executive – you will apply this exercise to your own team.
You are laying the foundation for real talent conversations, development paths, and (if needed) tough decisions.

#### Practical benefits

By doing this well, you’ll:

*   Identify key people risks before they explode.
*   Match talent to roles more effectively.
*   Drive a team culture where performance and values align.

#### Possible dangers of not tackling it well

By doing this well, you’ll:

*   Letting poor FITs drag down energy and execution.
*   Ignoring cultural misalignment that poisons morale.
*   Missed opportunities to realign high-potential people.

### [02/05] Review of Last Sprint and Learnings (10 minutes)

Reflect on how the brand and marketing work from the previous sprint should now inform service execution.

**Start**

### [03/05] Reading for This Week (15 minutes)

This is your team’s health check. FIT and ABC are your diagnostic tools. If someone’s in the wrong role or misaligned with your values, this process helps you act—quickly and constructively.
Before diving into the reading, consider these questions to prime your mind:

#### Tune-in questions

01. What signs have you seen that someone may not be in the right seat?
02. Do you feel confident assessing both skill and cultural contribution?
03. Are there team members you’ve hesitated to act on? Why?

#### preparation materials

**Key Documents and Required Reading**
[EXPECTED TIME: 30 MIN]
Brain Juice

### [04/05] think and do (60 minutes)

#### think

Reflect on the materials you will read and how they relate to your company. Consider the following:

01. Who in your team clearly belongs in the A zone (great performer, cultural fit)?
02. Who is performing well but is not a cultural fit?
03. Who drains energy or lacks results and why haven’t you acted yet?

#### Action Steps

Review the team tools:
*   FIT Analysis Grid
*   ABC Performance & Culture Matrix
CEO: reflect on each executive’s FIT and ABC placement.
Executives: reflect on the people in your own teams.
Do not fill out the grids yet—just gather your thoughts and examples.

#### Supporting Questions:

*   What data or examples justify your reflection?
*   Where do you need more courage in your people decisions?

### [05/05] Mind Rehearsal (10 minutes)

Visualize where your voice matters most:

01. How can the concepts you’ve learned be applied to your current business challenges?
02. What are the top three actions you can take based on this new knowledge?
02. How can you share and apply these insights within your team to maximize impact?

Be ready to speak clearly, push hard, and drive decisions.

#### final Tips

*   Come in prepared with observations, not judgments.
*   Be direct, but constructive—it’s about solutions, not blame.
*   If you do this well, you will save months of misalignment and frustration later.

### [01/08] Tune-In Questions (10 min)

**Start**

### [02/08] WHY THIS MATTERS

People aren’t your greatest asset. The right people are.

Misalignment between roles, values, and expectations slows down execution, leads to poor decisions, and blocks growth. This sprint helps you address the root cause of underperformance: fit and clarity.

### [03/08] Understanding the ABC Tool

Each person in your company should be assessed across these four dimensions. If the answer to any of these is weak or uncertain, you may have a misfit:

*   **A**re they delivering results?
*   **B**ehaviors aligned with values?
*   **C**apable of future growth?
*   **D**oes their role energize them?

#### Critical Point

ABC is not a ranking tool, it’s a decision and coaching tool. It should be done quarterly and openly, not hidden in HR files.

### [04/08] How This Drives Culture and Execution

*   **Clarity:** Everyone knows what matters, both culturally and in delivery.
*   **Speed:** Managers don’t waste time on unclear cases.
*   **Culture:** Mediocrity doesn’t get silently rewarded. A-players don’t feel alone or frustrated.

### [05/08] Where Companies Go Wrong

*   Confusing activity with output - “They work hard” isn’t enough if they don’t deliver.
*   Avoiding hard conversations - C-players quietly kill momentum.
*   Rewarding wrong fit - Even if they hit targets, values misfit is toxic.
*   Using ABC secretly - Transparency builds accountability, not resentment.

### [06/08] Managing Each Player Type

This sprint will give your team the clarity and courage to make one of the most strategic moves any company can make: building a team that fits and performs. It is the foundation for agility, morale, and long-term scalability.

### [07/08] The Four FIT Questions

Each person in your company should be assessed across these four dimensions. If the answer to any of these is weak or uncertain, you may have a misfit:

1.  **Energy:** Does this role energize them, or drain them?
2.  **Skill:** Do they have the natural talents and learned skills for this role?
3.  **Values:** Are their personal values aligned with the company’s core values?
4.  **Impact:** Are they making a significant, measurable contribution?

#### Why it works

When the answer to all four questions is “yes,” performance and engagement skyrocket. Misalignment in any area can lead to frustration, turnover, or mediocrity.

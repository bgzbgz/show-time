## Creating and Living Company Values

### Sprint introduction

Values are the invisible backbone of your organization. They shape every decision, behavior, and interaction within your company. Without them, you’re directionless—risking internal conflict and poor decision-making. Clear, actionable values create a strong, cohesive culture that drives success and attracts like-minded individuals.

### Why values matter

Values are the foundation of your company’s culture. They guide how employees interact, make decisions, and shape how your company is perceived by the outside world. Without clear values, you risk losing direction and purpose. A strong set of values unites your team, driving long-term success.

### Consequences of neglecting values

Ignoring values leads to internal conflict, disengagement, and a loss of direction. Employees become disillusioned, and your company’s reputation suffers. Without strong values, you lose your competitive edge and your way.

### What you will achieve

By the end of this sprint, you will have:
*   A clear, actionable set of company values.
*   A culture where these values are lived and reinforced every day.
*   A team that embodies the company’s values, driving long-term success.

### The journey so far

You’ve established your company’s identity and dream. Now it’s time to define the core values that will guide your organization. These values will serve as your compass, ensuring every decision aligns with your long-term vision.

### Applying values

Integrate values into key processes like hiring, performance management, and decision-making. Regularly communicate these values to ensure they are understood and lived by everyone. Monitor and adjust them as needed to keep them relevant and aligned with your goals.

### Fast Track 80/20

Focus on the 20% of values that drive 80% of your results. These are the values you must live every day, in every decision and action. Keep your values simple, clear, and actionable to ensure they have a real impact on your company’s culture and success.

### [02/04] Reading for This Week
(15 minutes)

> “Your beliefs become your thoughts,
> Your thoughts become your words,
> Your words become your actions,
> Your actions become your habits,
> Your habits become your values,
> Your values become your destiny.”
> [MAHATMA GANDHI]

Mahatma Gandhi eloquently illustrated the domino effect of values: they spring from beliefs, guide actions, and, ultimately, shape our destiny.

People naturally act in accordance with their own highest values. Your values determine your attention - what you notice and your intention - how you intend to act. This creates your mindset. Your values inform your biases, lending extra weight to those intentions that align with your highest values.

In business, values are more than just nice statements. They're the rules of the game that help you reach your big goals. While it's possible to attain short-term success without strong values, you won't build a standout company and legacy that way.

#### Tune-in questions
1.  How do your company values currently influence daily decisions and behaviors?
2.  What actions show or clash with your company values?

### [01/07] Tune-In Questions
(10 min)

Start

---

### [02/07] fast track 80/20: KEY LEARNINGS

#### Values as the invisible backbone of your organization

Values are the invisible religion of your business, the guiding principles that shape every decision, behavior, and interaction. They act as a magnet, attracting like-minded individuals who resonate with your company’s mission and culture. At the same time, values serve as an immune system, identifying and addressing behaviors or attitudes that don’t align with the organization’s core principles.

#### From norms to visible behaviors

While social norms like integrity or trust are important, they are not actionable values. True company values must translate into specific, visible behaviors. Instead of vague statements, values should be clear guidelines on how to act and how not to act. This approach ensures that values are lived and reinforced daily, rather than being merely aspirational.

#### Cool and not cool behaviors

For each value, it’s essential to define what behaviors are “cool” (aligning with the value) and “not cool” (violating the value). This clarity makes it easier for everyone in the company to understand and adhere to the values. For example, if transparency is a value, “cool” might be characterized by openly sharing information, while “not cool” could be characterized by withholding critical data from team members.

#### Values in action

Values must be more than words on a wall. They should be reflected in every aspect of your company - from hiring and decision-making to conflict resolution and performance management. When values are consistently applied, they create a strong, cohesive culture that drives long-term success.

#### Steven Bartlett on values

Steven Bartlett emphasizes that values are not just about words; they are about the behaviors that accompany them. He advocates for values that are simple, clear, and actionable so everyone in the organization knows what is expected of them. According to Bartlett, values should inspire action, foster a sense of belonging, and drive the company forward.

#### Steve Jobs on Values

Steve Jobs believed that values are the bedrock of a company’s identity. He argued that clear values provide a compass for decision-making and help create a culture of excellence. Jobs insisted that values should be deeply embedded in the company’s DNA, influencing everything from product development to customer interactions.

---

### [03/07] Why Values Matter

#### The Foundation of Culture

Values are the foundation of your company’s culture. They influence how employees interact with each other, how decisions are made, and how the company is perceived by the outside world. A strong set of values creates a sense of unity and purpose, guiding the company through challenges and opportunities.

#### The Consequences of Neglecting Values

Failing to define and live by clear values can lead to a host of problems, including internal conflict, poor decision-making, and a lack of direction. Employees may become disengaged, and the company’s reputation could suffer as a result. Without a strong value system, the company risks losing its way and its competitive edge.

#### Summary of the Journey So Far

##### Building a value-driven organization

You’ve laid the groundwork by defining your company’s identity and setting the stage for future growth. Now, it’s time to dive deeper into the core values that will guide your organization. By clearly defining and consistently living these values, you’ll create a strong, cohesive culture that supports your long-term vision.

By the end of this process, you will have:
*   A clear, actionable set of company values that are reflected in daily behaviors.
*   A culture where values are lived and reinforced every day.
*   A team that understands and embodies the company’s values, driving long-term success.

---

### [04/07] Applying Values: The Next Steps

#### Integrate Values into Daily Operations

Begin by integrating values into key processes, including hiring, performance management, and decision-making. Ensure that every employee understands how these values should influence their actions and decisions.

#### Communicate and Reinforce Values

Regularly communicate the company’s values to all employees. Use stories, examples, and role models to reinforce these values and show how they contribute to the company’s success.

#### Monitor and Adjust

Values are not static; they should evolve with the company. Regularly review your values to ensure they remain relevant and effective. Be open to feedback and make adjustments as needed to keep your values aligned with the company’s goals.

---

### [05/07] The Impact of Living Your Values

#### Attract and Retain Talent

A strong value system attracts like-minded individuals who are passionate about the company’s mission. Employees who align with the company’s values are more likely to stay engaged and committed, reducing turnover and increasing job satisfaction.

#### Build a Strong Brand

Companies that consistently live their values build strong brands that resonate with customers, partners, and the broader community. Values-driven companies are often seen as trustworthy, reliable, and ethical, which can lead to increased loyalty and business success.

#### Drive Long-Term Success

Values provide a roadmap for long-term success. They guide the company through challenges, inspire innovation, and create a culture of excellence. By living your values, you ensure that your company remains focused, resilient, and aligned with its vision.

### [07/07] Final Thought

Values are the heartbeat of your organization. They define who you are, guide your decisions, and shape your future. By creating and living clear, actionable values, you build a strong, cohesive culture that drives long-term success. Remember, values are not just words; they are the behaviors that define your company and set you apart from the competition.

## CORE VALUES IDENTIFICATION

**Tool explanation and guide – FOR REVIEW ONLY**

---

### [01/07] TOOL PREVIEW

---

### [02/07] Purpose

This tool is essential for establishing the core behaviors that will guide every action and decision within your company. It follows the creation of the company’s Dream, ensuring that the values provide a strong foundation for how the team will operate to achieve that Dream.

### tool logic

This tool is grounded in the Fast Track principles of simplicity, brutal honesty, and the 80/20 rule. By focusing on specific behaviors, the tool helps companies create a set of core values that are not only unique but also actionable and enforceable, ensuring alignment across the organization.

---

### [03/07] Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Preparation
(40 minutes)

##### Individual Task
(30 minutes)
Each team member should reflect on the company’s mission and Dream, considering what behaviors are essential to achieve these goals.
Write down specific actions or behaviors you believe are critical for success. For example, instead of writing "integrity," note "We admit our mistakes and learn from them quickly."

##### Team Preparation
(10 minutes)
Before the meeting, gather all individual reflections on behaviors and group them into themes or categories. Prepare these for discussion in the team session.

#### 2. Team Session
(55 minutes)

##### Introduction
(5 minutes)
Begin by reviewing the company’s Dream and discussing why core values are crucial to achieving it.

##### Behavior Brainstorming
(20 minutes)
As a team, discuss the behaviors that everyone submitted. Focus on specific actions that align with the company’s goals. Encourage team members to be brutally honest and specific.
Identify “Cool” and “Not Cool” behaviors—what is acceptable and what is not within the organization. For instance, “Cool: Giving direct feedback to colleagues. Not Cool: Avoiding difficult conversations.”

##### Prioritization and Simplification
(20 minutes)
Narrow down the behaviors to 5-7 core values that everyone agrees are essential. Use the 80/20 rule to focus on the few behaviors that will have the most significant impact.
Ensure these values are simple, clear, and actionable.

##### Finalization
(10 minutes)
Document the agreed-upon values with specific examples of “Cool” and “Not Cool” behaviors.
Discuss how these values will be communicated to the rest of the organization and how they will be integrated into daily operations.

#### 3. Documentation and Communication:
(10 minutes)

Write down the final list of core values with examples of associated behaviors.
Plan how these values will be shared with the entire organization—consider creating posters, handouts, or including them in onboarding materials.
Schedule a follow-up meeting to review how well these values are being lived in practice.

---

### [04/07] mistakes to avoid

1.  **Being vague**
    Avoid generic terms. Values should be specific and directly tied to observable behaviors.
2.  **Overcomplicating**
    Keep values simple and easy to understand. Complex values are hard to remember and even harder to live by.
3.  **Inconsistency**
    Ensure that all leaders embody and enforce these values consistently. Mixed messages can undermine the values.
4.  **Lack of communication**
    Failing to communicate values clearly and regularly will lead to them being forgotten or ignored.
5.  **Not living the values**
    Values that are not consistently applied lose their power and meaning.

---

### [05/07] f.a.q. and answers

1.  **What if our values are too similar to those of other companies?**
    Focus on behaviors that are unique to your company’s culture and mission. Values should be specific and reflect the way you operate, not just generic terms like “innovation” or “excellence.”
2.  **How do we handle disagreements about which values to prioritize?**
    Facilitate a discussion where team members explain why they believe certain behaviors are more critical. Use the company’s Dream as a guide to resolve disagreements and prioritize values that align most closely with your long-term goals.
3.  **What if our values change over time?**
    Values should be reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant. If necessary, adjust them to reflect the company’s evolving mission and goals.
4.  **How do we ensure that these values are lived every day?**
    Integrate values into all aspects of the business—hiring, performance reviews, decision-making processes, and daily interactions. Make them a part of your company’s DNA.
5.  **Can we have more than 7 core values?**
    It’s best to keep the list concise. Too many values can dilute focus and make it harder for employees to remember and live by them.

---

### [06/07] Case Study

#### Before

A company had a list of values including “Integrity,” “Innovation,” and “Customer-Centricity.” However, these values were not reflected in daily behaviors, and employees often felt that decisions were made arbitrarily.

#### After

Using the Core Values identification tool, the company refined their values into specific behaviors such as:
*   Cool: “We speak up when we see something wrong.”
*   Not Cool: “We avoid difficult conversations.”

These values were then communicated through a series of workshops, integrated into performance reviews, and made a part of the company’s daily operations. As a result, the company saw a significant improvement in employee engagement and decision-making consistency.

## TRANSLATING VALUES INTO BEHAVIORS

**Tool explanation and guide – FOR REVIEW ONLY**

---

### [01/06] TOOL PREVIEW

---

### [02/06] Purpose

After identifying your core values, the next critical step is to translate these values into specific, actionable behaviors that will guide your company’s daily operations. This tool fits within the logical sequence of the program by ensuring that values are not just abstract concepts but are embedded into every action and decision within the company.

### logic

This tool is based on the Fast Track principles of simplicity and brutal honesty. By focusing on specific, actionable behaviors, it helps companies ensure that their values are not just statements but are actively lived out in the organization. This approach reinforces the company’s culture and aligns daily operations with long-term goals.

---

### [03/06] Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Preparation
(10 minutes)

##### Team Leader Task
Review the core values identified in the previous tool.
Prepare examples of behaviors that align with these values to facilitate the discussion.

#### 2. Team Session
(60 minutes)

##### Introduction
(5 minutes)
Begin by revisiting the core values defined in the previous session. Emphasize the importance of translating these values into specific behaviors that can be observed and measured.

##### Behaviors brainstorming
(20 minutes)
As a team, brainstorm specific behaviors that reflect each core value. Encourage team members to think of real-life examples that illustrate these behaviors.
For each value, create a list of “Cool” and “Not Cool” behaviors.

**Example**
If a core value is Collaboration, a “Cool” behavior might be “Actively listening during meetings,” while a “Not Cool” behavior could be “Interrupting others.”

##### Prioritization and simplification
(20 minutes)
Narrow down the behaviors to a manageable list that clearly illustrates each value. Ensure these behaviors are simple, clear, and actionable.
Use the 80/20 rule to focus on the few behaviors that will have the most significant impact on reinforcing your company’s values.

##### Finalization
(10 minutes)

---

### [04/06] mistakes to avoid

1.  **Vagueness**
    Avoid vague descriptions of behaviors. Each behavior should be specific and easily observable.
2.  **Inconsistency**
    Ensure that behaviors are consistently applied across the organization. Inconsistent enforcement undermines the values.
3.  **Overcomplicating**
    Keep behaviors simple and clear. Overly complex behaviors are hard to remember and enforce.
4.  **Ignoring feedback**
    Be open to feedback from employees about how these behaviors are working in practice and make adjustments if needed.
5.  **Lack of integration**
    Make sure these behaviors are integrated into daily operations, not just stated in a document.

---

### [05/06] f.a.q. and answers

1.  **What if some behaviors seem too specific or limiting?**
    Focus on behaviors that are broadly applicable across different scenarios. The goal is to create guidelines that are specific enough to be actionable but flexible enough to apply in various situations.
2.  **How do we ensure that everyone understands and adopts these behaviors?**
    Communication and reinforcement are key. Use workshops, meetings, and regular check-ins to ensure that everyone understands the behaviors and sees them modeled by leadership.
3.  **Can these behaviors evolve over time?**
    Yes, behaviors should be reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant and effective. Be open to refining them as the company grows and changes.
4.  **What if there is disagreement about what constitutes a “Cool” or “Not Cool” behavior?**
    Facilitate open discussions to understand different perspectives. Use the company’s core values and Dream as a guide to resolve disagreements and reach a consensus.
5.  **How do we handle employees who consistently exhibit “Not Cool” behaviors?**
    Address these issues directly and constructively. Use the defined behaviors as a framework for feedback and improvement. If necessary, escalate to performance reviews or other formal processes.

---

### [06/06] Case Study

#### Before

A company identified “Innovation” as a core value but struggled to translate this into daily actions. Employees were unclear on what behaviors would support this value, leading to inconsistent practices and a lack of direction.

#### After

Using the Values Translation into Behaviors Tool, the company defined specific behaviors such as:
*   Cool: "We actively seek out and test new ideas, even if they challenge the status quo.”
*   Not Cool: “We avoid taking risks because we fear failure.”

These behaviors were communicated through workshops and became a key part of the company’s performance review process. As a result, the company saw a noticeable increase in innovative projects and a stronger culture of experimentation.

## VALUES ALIGNMENT CHECK TOOL

**Tool explanation and guide – FOR REVIEW ONLY**

---

### [01/06] TOOL PREVIEW

---

### [02/06] Purpose

After defining core values and translating them into specific behaviors, the next step is to ensure that these values are aligned across the entire organization. This tool fits into the logical sequence by helping the team assess whether the defined values are truly reflected in the company’s culture and operations, ensuring consistency and alignment.

### logic

This tool leverages the Fast Track principles of brutal honesty and simplicity to ensure that the company’s values are not just words but are truly reflected in daily operations. By regularly checking for alignment and addressing gaps, the organization can maintain a strong, consistent culture that supports its long-term goals.

---

### [03/06] Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Preparation
(10 minutes)

##### Team Leader Task
Prepare a summary of the core values and their corresponding behaviors that were defined in the previous tools.
Gather feedback from key team members on how these values are currently perceived and lived within the organization.

#### 2. Team Session
(60 minutes)

##### Introduction
(5 minutes)
Start by revisiting the company’s core values and the specific behaviors associated with each value.
Emphasize the importance of aligning stated values with actual behaviors to maintain a strong, consistent culture.

##### Values reflection
(20 minutes)
As a team, reflect on the current state of the organization. Discuss whether the defined values are truly reflected in daily operations, decision-making processes, and interactions within the company.
Encourage team members to share examples where they see alignment or misalignment between the stated values and actual behaviors.

##### Alignment check
(20 minutes)
Use a simple checklist or rating system to assess the alignment of each value across different areas of the organization (e.g., leadership, team dynamics, customer interactions).
Identify areas where alignment is strong and areas where improvements are needed. For example, if “Transparency” is a core value, assess how well information is shared across teams and with customers.

##### Action planning
(10 minutes)
For any areas of misalignment, develop an action plan to address the gaps. This may involve additional training, adjustments to communication practices, or revisiting specific processes.
Assign responsibilities and set timelines for implementing these actions to ensure alignment is achieved.

#### 3. Documentation and communication

Document the findings from the alignment check, including areas of strength and areas needing improvement.
Communicate these findings to the broader organization, highlighting the steps that will be taken to improve alignment where necessary.
Schedule a follow-up session to review progress and ensure that the alignment actions are being implemented effectively.

---

### [04/06] mistakes to avoid

1.  **Superficial assessment**
    Avoid simply ticking boxes. Ensure that the alignment check is thorough and that feedback is honest and constructive.
2.  **Ignoring feedback**
    If misalignment is identified, take it seriously and act on it. Ignoring issues will only lead to further misalignment and dissatisfaction.
3.  **Lack of follow-Up**
    Ensure that the action plans developed during the session are followed through and revisited to maintain alignment.
4.  **Overcomplicating the process**
    Keep the alignment check simple and focused. The goal is to identify key areas for improvement, rather than overburdening the team with complex assessments.
5.  **Inconsistent leadership**
    Leaders must consistently model the company’s values. Inconsistent behavior behavior from leadership can undermine the entire alignment process.

---

### [05/06] f.a.q. and answers

1.  **What if we find significant misalignment between values and behaviors?**
    Misalignment is an opportunity for improvement. Use it as a chance to refine your processes, improve communication, and reinforce the importance of living the company’s values.
2.  **How do we measure alignment effectively?**
    Use a simple rating system or checklist to evaluate how well each value is reflected in different areas of the company. Be specific about what “good alignment” looks like for each value.
3.  **What if certain values are not being upheld consistently by leadership?**
    Address this directly with leadership. Leaders must model the behaviors associated with the company’s values to set the standard for the rest of the organization.
4.  **How do we ensure that alignment is maintained over time?**
    Regularly review and assess alignment as part of your ongoing performance management and team development processes. Continuous monitoring helps maintain alignment as the organization evolves.
5.  **Can we adjust values if we find they are not resonating with the team?**
    Yes, values should be revisited and adjusted if they no longer align with the company’s direction or culture. However, any changes should be communicated clearly and implemented consistently.

---

### [06/06] Case Study

#### Before

A company had defined “Collaboration” as a core value, but internal silos and poor communication practices led to inconsistent collaboration across teams. This misalignment caused frustration and inefficiencies.

#### After

Using the Values Alignment Check Tool, the company identified specific areas where collaboration was lacking, including cross-departmental projects and communication. An action plan was developed to improve collaboration, including regular inter-departmental meetings and a shared project management platform. As a result, collaboration improved, leading to more cohesive teams and better project outcomes.

## RECRUITMENT VALUES QUESTIONNAIRE

**Tool explanation and guide – FOR REVIEW ONLY**

---

### [01/06] TOOL PREVIEW

---

### [02/06] Purpose

To ensure that new hires align with the company’s core values from the outset, this tool helps the team develop a values-based recruitment questionnaire. This questionnaire is designed to assess candidates’ alignment with the company’s values during the hiring process, ensuring that new employees are a cultural fit and will contribute to reinforcing the organization’s identity.

---

### [03/06] Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Preparation
(10 minutes)

##### Team Leader Task
Review the company’s core values and identify the key behaviors that reflect these values. Consider how these behaviors should be demonstrated by potential new hires.
Prepare a draft of potential questions that could be used to assess candidates’ alignment with the company’s values during the recruitment process.

#### 2. Team Session
(60 minutes)

##### Introduction
(5 minutes)
Start by discussing the importance of hiring employees who not only have the right skills but also align with the company’s core values. Emphasize that the recruitment process is the first step in ensuring that new hires will make a positive contribution to the company’s culture.

##### Questionnaire development
(25 minutes)
As a team, collaborate to develop a set of interview questions that assess a candidate’s alignment with the company’s values. These questions should be designed to elicit responses that reveal the candidate’s behaviors, attitudes, and decision-making processes.
Example questions might include: “Can you describe a time when you had to make a difficult decision that tested your integrity?” or “How do you handle conflicts with team members who have different values than you?”

##### Scenario-based questions
(20 minutes)
Develop scenario-based questions that present candidates with realistic situations they might face in the role. These scenarios should challenge candidates to apply the company’s values in their responses.
For example, a scenario might involve handling a disagreement with a colleague or making a decision under pressure. Candidates would be asked how they would respond, with a focus on how their actions align with the company’s values.

##### Action planning and implementation
(10 minutes)
Document the values-based recruitment questionnaire and ensure it is integrated into the company’s hiring process. Assign responsibilities for training hiring managers on how to effectively use the questionnaire.
Develop a timeline for rolling out the questionnaire and monitoring its effectiveness in identifying candidates who align with the company’s values.

#### 3. Documentation and communication

Document the values-based recruitment questionnaire and make it accessible to all hiring managers. Include guidelines on how to use the questions during interviews and how to evaluate responses.
Communicate the importance of values-based recruitment to the broader organization, emphasizing that hiring employees who align with the company’s values is critical to maintaining a strong, cohesive culture.
Monitor the effectiveness of the questionnaire by gathering feedback from hiring managers and new hires and make adjustments as necessary.

---

### [04/06] mistakes to avoid

1.  **Superficial assessment**
    Ensure that the questions go beyond surface-level responses and delve into the candidate’s true behaviors and attitudes. Superficial questions may not reveal whether a candidate truly aligns with the company’s values.
2.  **Inconsistent application**
    Use the values-based recruitment questionnaire consistently across all hiring processes. Inconsistent use can lead to a lack of alignment and potential cultural issues.
3.  **Neglecting scenario-based questions**
    Scenario-based questions are essential for evaluating how candidates apply their values in real-world situations. Neglecting these questions can lead to an incomplete assessment of value alignment.
4.  **Overemphasizing skills over values**
    While skills are important, don’t overlook the importance of values alignment. A highly skilled candidate who doesn’t align with the company’s values can disrupt the culture and negatively impact the team.
5.  **Ignoring feedback**
    Gather feedback from hiring managers and new hires to continually refine the questionnaire. Ignoring feedback can result in a tool that becomes less effective over time.

---

### [05/06] f.a.q. and answers

1.  **Why is it important to assess values alignment during recruitment?**
    Hiring employees who align with the company’s values ensures that they will contribute positively to the company’s culture and reinforce its identity from the outset. This alignment helps build a cohesive and committed team.
2.  **How do we ensure that the questionnaire effectively assesses values alignment?**
    Design the questions to elicit responses that reveal a candidate’s behaviors and attitudes. Use scenario-based questions to assess how candidates would apply the company’s values in real-world situations.
3.  **What if a candidate’s responses suggest they may not align with our values?**
    Address this concern during the interview by asking follow-up questions to clarify the candidate’s perspective. If misalignment is evident, consider whether the candidate is a good cultural fit for the company.
4.  **Can the questionnaire be adapted for different roles or departments?**
    Yes, while the core questions should reflect the company’s values, they can be tailored to fit the specific requirements and challenges of different roles or departments.
5.  **How do we measure the success of values-based recruitment?**
    Monitor the performance and cultural fit of new hires over time to assess how effectively the questionnaire identifies candidates who align with the company’s values. Gather feedback from hiring managers and adjust the questionnaire as needed.

### [06/06] Case Study

#### Before

A company’s recruitment process focused primarily on assessing candidates’ technical skills and experience, with little emphasis on values alignment. As a result, the company occasionally hired individuals who were technically proficient but did not fit well with the company’s culture, leading to conflicts and disengagement.

#### After

Using the Recruitment Values Questionnaire Tool, the company developed a set of values-based interview questions that were integrated into the hiring process. This included both behavioral and scenario-based questions designed to assess how well candidates aligned with the company’s core values. As a result, the company experienced an improvement in cultural fit among new hires, resulting in a more cohesive and engaged workforce.

This tool helps the team develop strategies to embed these values into the company culture, making them a living part of everyday operations.

---

### [03/06] Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Preparation
(10 minutes)

##### Team Leader Task
Review the list of core values and the corresponding behaviors established in previous sessions.
Develop ideas for effectively communicating these values to the entire organization and for integrating them into daily practices.

#### 2. Team Session
(60 minutes)

##### Introduction
(5 minutes)
Begin by discussing the importance of not just defining values but actively living them within the company.
Emphasize that effective communication and integration are crucial to ensuring that values are consistently upheld.

##### Values Communication Brainstorming
(20 minutes)
As a team, brainstorm different ways to communicate the company’s values to all employees. Consider multiple channels such as meetings, newsletters, visual displays in the office, and digital platforms.
Discuss how to make these communications engaging and memorable. For example, consider using storytelling, employee testimonials, or visual graphics to illustrate the values in action.

##### Integration into Daily Operations
(20 minutes):
Identify key areas of the business where values should be integrated, such as hiring processes, performance evaluations, decision-making frameworks, and customer interactions.
Develop specific strategies for embedding values into these areas. For example, ensure that interview questions for new hires reflect the company’s values, and that performance reviews include an assessment of how well employees embody these values.

##### Action planning and implementation
(10 minutes)
Create an action plan that outlines specific steps for both communication and integration of values. Assign responsibilities to team members for each part of the plan.
Set deadlines and follow up on meetings to ensure that the plan is implemented effectively and that values become a natural part of the company’s culture.

#### 3. Documentation and communication

Document the strategies and action plans developed during the session.
Share the communication plan with the broader organization, and start implementing it immediately.
Monitor the effectiveness of these strategies through employee feedback and regular reviews, making adjustments as needed.

### [04/06] mistakes to avoid

1.  **Inconsistent communication**
    Ensure that the values are communicated consistently across all platforms and by all leaders. Mixed messages can confuse employees and undermine the values.
2.  **Overcomplicating the message**
    Keep communication clear and straightforward. Avoid jargon and ensure that the values are easy to understand and relate to.
3.  **Neglecting integration**
    Values should be embedded into every aspect of the company’s operations. Failure to integrate them into daily practices will result in them being ignored or forgotten.
4.  **Ignoring employee feedback**
    Listen to how employees perceive the values and their integration. Adjust strategies based on feedback to improve engagement and alignment.
5.  **Lack of follow-up**
    Implementing the communication and integration strategies is just the first step. Regularly follow up to ensure that the values remain a living part of the company culture.

---

### [05/06] f.a.q. and answers

1.  **What if employees don’t seem to engage with the values communication?**
    Experiment with various communication methods until you find the one that resonates with your team. Consider more interactive or visual approaches to make the values more relatable and engaging.
2.  **How do we ensure values are truly integrated into daily operations?**
    Regularly review key business processes to ensure they align with the values. Incorporate the values into all employee touchpoints, from onboarding to performance reviews.
3.  **Can values evolve over time?**
    Yes, values can and should evolve as the company grows and changes. However, any updates to values should be communicated clearly and implemented consistently.
4.  **How do we handle situations where values are not being lived by some employees?**
    Address these issues directly and promptly. Use the defined behaviors as a framework for feedback and improvement, and if necessary, take further action to align the employee with the company’s values.
5.  **How often should we revisit our values communication and integration strategies?**
    Regularly, at least annually, or more often if the company is undergoing significant changes. Continuous reinforcement is crucial for maintaining a strong, values-driven culture.

### [06/06] Case Study

#### Before

A company had a set of core values but struggled to communicate them effectively. Employees were unaware of the values, and as a result, they were not reflected in daily operations.

#### After

Using the Values Communication and Integration Tool, the company developed a multi-channel communication strategy that included regular town hall meetings, visual displays in the office, and a dedicated section in the company newsletter. Values were also integrated into performance reviews and hiring practices. The result was a more cohesive culture where employees were aligned with the company’s values and motivated to live them daily.

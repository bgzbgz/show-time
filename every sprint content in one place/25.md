### How Sprint 4 Builds on Your Foundation

**Integration Logic: Each Sprint Builds the Next**
Sprint 1 → Sprint 2 → Sprint 3 → Sprint 4
Structure → Decisions → People → Implementation
Each sprint creates inputs for the next sprint. Sprint 4 uses everything you've already built.

---

### What Each Sprint Delivered

#### Sprint 1: Core Structure Foundation

**Delivered:**
*   5 core activities that deliver your value proposition
*   3 critical processes that execute those activities
*   9 KPIs that measure process performance
*   Clear organizational structure chart

**Sprint 4 Uses This For:**
*   Role definitions, reporting relationships, performance expectations

#### Sprint 2: Decision & Capability Framework

**Delivered:**
*   Key decisions required for each core activity
*   Capabilities needed to execute decisions effectively
*   Gap analysis between current and required capabilities
*   Data requirements for decision-making

**Sprint 4 Uses This For:**
*   Role specifications, development plans, hiring requirements

#### Sprint 3: People Assessment Reality

**Delivered:**
*   FIT scores for every team member (Company/Job/Team/Boss)
*   ABC player ratings (Values alignment vs Performance)
*   Honest evaluation of current team capabilities
*   Development potential assessment

**Sprint 4 Uses This For:**
*   People-role matching, transition planning, development priorities

---

### What Sprint 4 Does NOT Repeat

*   No re-evaluating people - Uses Sprint 3 FIT/ABC data
*   No redefining structure - Uses Sprint 1 core activities
*   No recreating processes - Uses Sprint 1 process map
*   No redoing capability analysis - Uses Sprint 2 requirements

**Sprint 4 Focus:**
Integration and implementation only.

---

### What's Actually New in Sprint 4:

1.  **People-Role Assignment Matrix**
    *   Connects Sprint 3 people data to Sprint 1 structure
    *   Makes final placement decisions using existing analysis
    *   Creates transition timeline for changes

2.  **90-Day Implementation Roadmap**
    *   Sequences people transitions for minimal disruption
    *   Integrates capability development from Sprint 2
    *   Establishes measurement

3.  **Communication Strategy**
    *   Tailored messages for different audiences
    *   Timeline for announcing and implementing changes
    *   Crisis communication protocols

4.  **Change Management Support**
    *   Development plans for B+ players (using Sprint 2 capabilities)
    *   Transition support for role changes
    *   Performance tracking during transformation

---

### How the Integration Actually Works

**Step 1: Take Sprint 1 Structure**
*   Core Activity: Customer Acquisition
*   Process: Lead Generation
*   KPI: Lead conversion rate

**Step 2: Add Sprint 2 Requirements**
*   Key Decision: Which channels to prioritize
*   Capability Needed: Data analysis + digital marketing

**Step 3: Apply Sprint 3 People Data**
*   Current Person: Sarah K.
*   FIT Score: 34/40 (Company: 9, Job: 8, Team: 9, Boss: 8)
*   ABC Rating: B+ player

**Step 4: Make Sprint 4 Implementation Decision**
*   Assignment: Sarah K. → Head of Customer Acquisition
*   Plan: Promote immediately + data analysis training
*   Timeline: Week 2 promotion, Month 1-2 training

---

### Pre-Sprint Integration Checklist

Before starting Sprint 4, confirm you have:

**From Sprint 1:**
*   Completed Core Activities & Processes Mapping Tool
*   5 core activities clearly defined and documented
*   3 critical processes identified with owners
*   9 KPIs established with measurement methods

**From Sprint 2:**
*   Completed Core Decisions & Capabilities Table
*   Key decisions identified for each core activity
*   Capability requirements documented
*   Current capability gaps identified

**From Sprint 3:**
*   Completed FIT Analysis for all team members
*   ABC ratings assigned to all team members
*   Development opportunities identified
*   Performance concerns documented

**If any checklist items are missing:**
*   Complete the missing sprint work before proceeding
*   Sprint 4 requires all previous outputs to succeed

---

### Sprint 4 Success Formula

**Input:** Sprint 1 structure + Sprint 2 requirements + Sprint 3 people data
**Process:** Integration + decision-making + planning
**Output:** Implementation roadmap + people assignments + change management

**Success Equation:**
Structure (Sprint 1) + Capabilities (Sprint 2) + Right People (Sprint 3) = Implementation Success (Sprint 4)

---

### Red Flags: When Integration Fails

**Warning Signs Sprint 4 Is Going Wrong:**
*   Team wants to "revisit" Sprint 1-3 decisions
*   People resist Sprint 3 FIT/ABC assessments
*   New analysis starts instead of using existing data
*   Structure changes being debated instead of implemented
*   Meeting turns into strategy session instead of implementation planning

**Fast Track response:**
"We're not reopening previous decisions. We're implementing them. If you want to change Sprint 1-3 outputs, schedule that for after implementation."

---

### Module Completion Criteria

*   Clear structure exists (Sprint 1)
*   Decision rights assigned (Sprint 2)
*   People honestly assessed (Sprint 3)
*   Implementation plan ready (Sprint 4)
*   90-day execution begins (Sprint 4)

**Result:**
Organization designed for speed, clarity, and performance.

## BRAIN JUICE

[01/13]
### Tune-In Questions
(10 min)

Start

[02/13]
### WHY THIS MATTERS

"You are only as good as the team you build. The most important decisions a leader makes are about people - who to hire, who to promote, who to put in what roles, and yes, who to let go."

- Reed Hastings, Netflix

This quote captures the essence of this sprint: organizational transformation is fundamentally about people's decisions. Your new organizational design is only as powerful as the people executing it. This sprint is where strategy meets reality - where your ideal structure becomes operational through the right human capital decisions.

#### STRIKING FACTS
*   Only 12% of organizational transformations achieve their full potential, primarily due to failures in managing the people side of change and not having A-players in critical positions.
*   Companies with highly engaged teams are 59% more likely to exceed performance targets during organizational transitions; however, 87% of change initiatives fail to properly assess and align people's fit during restructuring.
*   A-players are 400% more productive than average performers in complex roles - meaning one wrong person in a key position can derail your entire new organizational structure.

#### Metaphor: The Orchestra Conductor's Transition
Imagine your current organization as a jazz band that's been improvising together for years. Everyone knows their role, the music flows naturally, but you've decided to transform into a symphony orchestra to reach the next level of performance.

Your previous sprints identified the perfect symphony structure - which instruments you need (core activities), how they should work together (processes), and who makes key decisions (decision rights). You've even assessed your current musicians using ABC and FIT analysis.

Now comes the critical moment: transitioning from the jazz band to the symphony. Some musicians will flourish in their new orchestral roles, while others will require different instruments, and some talented jazz musicians may simply not fit the symphony's precision and structure.

This sprint is about making those tough conductor decisions - who stays, who moves to different chairs, who needs intensive coaching, and who needs to leave. The beautiful symphony score you've designed means nothing without the right musicians in the right seats, playing with perfect harmony.

**The key insight**

A mediocre symphony with the wrong people will always be outperformed by a great jazz band with the right people. But a great symphony with A-players in every chair creates magic that no jazz band can match.

[03/13]
### WHERE WE ARE

**Strategy Foundation Complete:**
*   Core activities identified and prioritized
*   Key processes mapped and optimized
*   Decision rights clarified and assigned
*   Current team assessed via ABC and FIT analysis

**The Challenge**

You now have two critical pieces: (1) the perfect organizational design and (2) an honest assessment of your current people. The gap between these two is your transformation challenge. This sprint bridges that gap with surgical precision.

**The Reality Check:**
*   Some A-players may not fit the new structure
*   Some positions may have no current A-player candidates
*   Change will create uncertainty and potential resistance
*   Speed is essential - delays breed confusion and politics

[04/13]
### What Needs to Be Done

**Phase 1: Gap Analysis and Decision Framework (Week 1)**
Map every person against every critical role in the new structure using your FIT and ABC data. Create a decision matrix that shows fit scores for each person-role combination. Identify immediate wins, development candidates, and tough decisions.

**Phase 2: Transition Planning (Week 2)**
Design the specific transition plan, including timing, communication strategy, interim arrangements, and mitigation for operational risks. Plan for both organizational structure changes and individual people moves.

**Phase 3: Implementation and Communication (Weeks 3-4)**
Execute the transition with clear, honest communication to all stakeholders. Announce new structure, role assignments, and expectations. Begin immediate coaching for development candidates.

**Phase 4: Stabilization and Optimization (Weeks 5-8)**
Monitor performance, adjust assignments as needed, and ensure new structure is functioning effectively. Address any remaining resistance or performance issues.

[05/13]
### Key Lessons from Best Practices

#### The Fast Track Dos:

*   **Speed Over Perfection**
    Research shows that successful transformations follow rigorous approaches with clear communication and defined roles. Move fast - prolonged uncertainty kills productivity and creates political maneuvering.

*   **Brutal Honesty as Kindness**
    Be direct about fit and performance. Transparent communication about changes and their implications builds trust and reduces resistance. Sugarcoating helps no one.

*   **A-Player Obsession**
    Only A-players in critical positions. B-players can be developed or moved to supporting roles. C-players must go - they contaminate team performance.

*   **Four-Dimensional Fit**
    Every placement decision must consider Company-Job-Team-Boss fit. Missing any dimension creates future problems.

*   **Communication Overdrive**
    The most successful transformations involve open communication across the organization about progress and implications for individuals' day-to-day work. Explain the why, what, and how repeatedly.

#### The Fatal Don'ts:

*   ❌ **Death by Committee**
    Don't over-discuss people's decisions. Make them fast with clear criteria.

*   ❌ **Hope as Strategy**
    Don't hope poor fits will improve. Effective sponsors who champion the vision and build momentum are essential for success. Address misalignment immediately.

*   ❌ **Politics Over Performance**
    Don't let relationships override fit data. Friendship is not a qualification.

*   ❌ **Change Fatigue Paralysis**
    Don't delay because people are "tired of change." Implement changes incrementally when possible, allowing employees to adjust gradually.

*   ❌ **One-Size-Fits-All Communication**
    Don't use the same message for A-players and C-players. Tailor your approach.

[06/13]
### Critical Success Factors

*   **Leadership Alignment**
    The executive team must be 100% aligned on people decisions before any announcements. No wavering, no second-guessing.

*   **Data-Driven Decisions**
    Every person's decision is backed by FIT scores, ABC ratings, and performance data. Emotion and politics are the enemy.

*   **Clear Success Metrics**
    Define exactly what success looks like in the new structure within 90 days. Make it measurable and public.

*   **Rapid Response Protocol**
    Plan for quick adjustments when initial placements are not effective. Speed of correction is as important as speed of implementation.

[07/13]
### Fast Track Implementation Tools

**What strategic organizational transformation requires**
*   People-Role Matrix: Visual mapping of all people against all roles with fit scores
*   90-Day Performance Dashboard: Track key metrics for new structure effectiveness
*   Communication Calendar: Structured messaging timeline for all stakeholders
*   Quick Decision Framework: Simple criteria for making fast people decisions
*   Resistance Management Playbook: Specific responses to common pushback scenarios

[08/13]
### Common Transformation Traps

*   **The "Everyone Can Adapt" Trap:**
    Believing that all current people can learn new roles. Successful transformation relies on changing how employees work and the culture within which they operate. Some fundamental mismatches cannot be fixed.

*   **The "Gradual Change" Trap:**
    Change management requires systematic approaches that facilitate the transformation of an organization's goals, processes, and culture. Slow transitions create confusion and resistance.

*   **The "Technical Fix" Trap:**
    Focusing only on structure and ignoring people's dynamics. Culture and relationships matter as much as reporting lines.

*   **The "Consensus Building" Trap:**
    Trying to get everyone to agree. Leadership means making tough decisions, not popular ones.

[09/13]
### Personal Development Plans (PDPs):
The Engine of Growth

If strategy defines where your company is going, people development defines how fast you’ll get there.
The best organizations don’t just fill roles - they grow the people who fill them. That’s where Personal Development Plans (PDPs) come in.

A PDP is not just for training. It’s a tool to unlock potential, align individual growth with company goals, and build a stronger, future-ready organization.

**PDPs are essential for:**
*   A-players who are already delivering results and need to be challenged to stay at the top
*   B+ players with high potential who can step up if given the right direction and investment

#### Why Personal Development Plans (PDPs) Matter
You’ve already set the foundation:
*   Defined the most critical roles - the right seats
*   Identified how to measure success - your KPIs
*   Spotted your top talent - A-players and B+ players with promise

Now it’s time to turn talent into traction:
*   Place your best people in the right roles
*   Build targeted growth plans to help them thrive and evolve

#### Practical Example
Let’s say data management is critical to your business.

You assign David, a solid B+ player, to lead it.

Ask the key question:
“What would David need to master to become one of the best data leaders in the world?”
That gives you your competency list.
Then, assess David’s current skills.

The gap between where he is and where he needs to be becomes his PDP - a clear roadmap for his development.

#### What Is a PDP?
A Personal Development Plan is a structured tool that:
*   Clarifies what a person needs to learn or improve to succeed in their role
*   Focuses training and coaching on what truly matters
*   Aligns individual growth with your company’s strategic direction
*   Creates transparency, accountability, and momentum for both the employee and the manager

**PDPs drive clarity, confidence, and capability.**
They’re not just about fixing weaknesses - they’re about building competitive advantage through people.

### Reflection Time
(10 min)

Start

[11/13]
### Implementation Challenges:

*   How will you manage the emotions and stress associated with organizational change while maintaining operational excellence?
*   What's your plan for retaining A-players who might be uncertain about their role in the new structure?
*   How will you accelerate the development of B+ players who could become A-players in the right environment?
*   What will you do if you discover you don't have A-players for critical positions in your new structure?

[12/13]
### Conclusion

This sprint marks the moment when your strategic vision becomes an operational reality. The organizational structure you've designed is perfect only if you have the right people executing it. Your ABC and FIT analysis has given you the data - now you must act on it with the speed and decisiveness that Fast Track demands.

Remember: mediocre people in a great structure will always underperform great people in an average structure. Your job is to create both great structure AND great people alignment.

The most successful leaders treat people decisions as their most important strategic decisions. They move fast, use data, communicate honestly, and don't compromise on A-player standards. This approach may seem harsh, but it is actually the kindest - it creates an environment where great people can do their best work and the organization can achieve its full potential.

"The best thing you can do for people is to put them in a position where they can succeed. Sometimes, that means having difficult conversations and making tough decisions. But that's what leadership is - making the hard choices that create the best outcomes for everyone."

- Jim Collins, Good to Great

#### The 10 Organizational Structure Killers
and How to Crush Them

**Brutal Truth About What Goes Wrong and How to Fix It**

##### Part 1: The 5 Sprint Meeting Killers

**Killer 1: "Everything is Core" Syndrome**

*   **What Happens:**
    Team argues that all activities are equally important. Marketing insists brand management is core. Finance claims budgeting is core. HR pushes talent acquisition as core. Everyone protects their territory instead of serving customers.

*   **Why It Kills You:**
    When everything is core, nothing is core. You end up with 15 "core" activities that spread your focus thinner than cheap paint. Mediocrity across everything beats excellence at nothing.

*   **How to Crush It:**
    Apply the customer disappearance test. Ask: "If we stopped doing this activity tomorrow, would customers immediately cancel contracts and call competitors?" If the answer is no, it's supporting, not core. Period.

    Force rank everything. Make them choose. Use CEO authority to break ties. Set a hard limit of 5 core activities maximum. No exceptions. No special cases. Five or fewer.

    **[GURU SCRIPT]**
    "I hear that this feels important to your department. But we're not organizing around what makes departments comfortable. We're organizing around what makes customers choose us over competitors."

**Killer 2: People Evaluation Paralysis**

*   **What Happens:**
    Team gets squeamish about honest FIT and ABC analysis. Lots of "everyone's trying their best" and "we don't want to hurt feelings." They avoid naming names. They speak in code. They protect underperformers to avoid uncomfortable conversations.

*   **Why It Kills You:**
    A players in wrong seats become C players. B players without development become C players. C players without honest feedback stay C players. Your organizational structure becomes a museum for mediocrity.

*   **How to Crush It:**
    Start with leadership self-assessment. CEO goes first. Model vulnerability and honesty. Use frameworks, not personal attacks. Focus on FIT dimensions: Company, Job, Team, Boss. Frame as development opportunity, not performance punishment.

    Make it data-driven. "Based on our FIT analysis, where do we see gaps?" Remove emotion. Add structure. Get specific about next steps.

    **[GURU SCRIPT]**
    "We're not here to judge people. We're here to help everyone succeed. A players in wrong seats are miserable. Helping people find their right seat is the kindest thing we can do."

**Killer 3: Analysis Paralysis on Process Definition**

*   **What Happens:**
    Team wants to document every step of every process before making decisions. They create flowcharts with 47 decision points. They debate whether email approval constitutes a subprocess. They turn simple process identification into doctoral dissertation planning.

*   **Why It Kills You:**
    Perfect documentation without decision-making creates zero value. You leave the meeting with beautiful diagrams and no clarity on who owns what or how success gets measured.

*   **How to Crush It:**
    Keep it simple. Process identification, not process documentation. Focus on: What happens? Who owns it? How do we measure success? That's it.

    Set strict time limits. Five minutes per process discussion maximum. Use timers visibly. Cut off perfectionist spirals immediately.

    **[GURU SCRIPT]**
    "We're identifying which processes matter most, not documenting every detail. Documentation comes after we decide what deserves documentation."

**Killer 4: Ownership Dodging**

*   **What Happens:**
    Nobody wants clear accountability for processes or outcomes. Everyone prefers collaborative ownership, shared responsibility, and committee decision-making. Phrases like "we all need to work together" and "it requires cross-functional coordination" dominate the discussion.

*   **Why It Kills You:**
    Shared ownership equals no ownership. When problems arise, finger-pointing replaces problem-solving. Nobody drives improvement because nobody owns results.

*   **How to Crush It:**
    Force individual ownership assignments before moving to the next topic. One person owns each core process. They can coordinate with others, but they own the results. No committees. No shared accountability. No exceptions.

    Write names on the whiteboard next to processes. Make it visible. Make it permanent.

    **[GURU SCRIPT]**
    "Process owners don't control people, they're accountable for results. If you own the process and it fails, you own the failure. If it succeeds, you own the success. Who wants that responsibility?"

**Killer 5: KPI Creation Madness**

*   **What Happens:**
    Team creates measurement systems that require PhD statisticians to understand. They want to track everything that moves. Seventeen KPIs per process. Metrics that need metrics to explain them. Reports that nobody will read measuring things that don't drive behavior.

*   **Why It Kills You:**
    Complex measurement systems get ignored. If you can't understand it in 30 seconds, you won't check it weekly. Measurement complexity kills measurement utility.

*   **How to Crush It:**
    Apply the weekly review test. Will the CEO actually check this metric every week? If no, eliminate it. Maximum 3 KPIs per core process. Must be simple, measurable, actionable.

    Ask: "Does this KPI predict success or just report what already happened?" Favor leading indicators over lagging indicators.

    **[GURU SCRIPT]**
    "If we create KPIs that nobody checks, we've created organizational theater, not organizational improvement. Simple metrics that drive behavior beat complex metrics that impress accountants."

##### Part 2: The 5 Implementation Execution Killers

**Killer 6: The Comfort Zone Snap-Back**

*   **What Happens:**
    Two weeks after the sprint, everyone reverts to old ways. The core activities list gets forgotten. Process owners stop owning processes. KPIs don't get checked. People drift back to familiar chaos because change feels uncomfortable.

*   **Why It Kills You:**
    Good intentions without systematic follow-through create zero organizational change. You get the pain of disruption without the benefit of improvement.

*   **How to Crush It:**
    Schedule weekly leadership meetings with mandatory KPI reviews. Make core activities visible - post them in conference rooms, email signatures, everywhere. Assign implementation deadlines with specific accountability.

    Create consequences for reverting to old ways. Reward new behavior immediately and visibly.

    **[IMPLEMENTATION SCRIPT]**
    "We're not going back to the old way because the old way was killing us. Anyone who wants to work the old way can work somewhere else."

**Killer 7: Measurement System Failure**

*   **What Happens:**
    KPIs get defined but never implemented. Data doesn't get collected. Reports don't get created. Process owners claim they're "too busy" to track metrics. The measurement system becomes another good idea that dies from neglect.

*   **Why It Kills You:**
    You can't manage what you don't measure. Without measurement, you have no idea if organizational changes are working. Process improvement becomes guesswork instead of data-driven optimization.

*   **How to Crush It:**
    Assign one person to own measurement system implementation. Give them authority and resources. Create simple tracking methods - spreadsheets beat complex software if people actually use them.

    Make KPI reviews mandatory agenda items in every leadership meeting. No measurement report, no meeting proceeds.

    **[IMPLEMENTATION SCRIPT]**
    "If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. If you're too busy to measure results, you're too busy to succeed."

**Killer 8: Role Change Resistance**

*   **What Happens:**
    People resist moving to new roles or taking on new responsibilities. They argue that FIT analysis was wrong. They claim they can improve in current roles if given more time. They create drama around necessary organizational changes.

*   **Why It Kills You:**
    Organizational structure changes require people changes. If people block necessary role adjustments, the entire structural improvement fails. You get stuck with old problems in new frameworks.

*   **How to Crush It:**
    Move fast on role changes. Announce decisions clearly with specific timelines. Provide transition support but not indefinite accommodation. Help people succeed in new roles or help them find success elsewhere.

    Frame role changes as development opportunities, not punishments. Show career advancement paths in new structure.

    **[IMPLEMENTATION SCRIPT]**
    "If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. If you're too busy to measure results, you're too busy to succeed."

**Killer 9: Process Owner Accountability Gaps**

*   **What Happens:**
    Process owners accept titles but avoid accountability. They claim they need more authority, more resources, more time, more cooperation from others. They become excuse generators instead of result drivers.

*   **Why It Kills You:**
    Process ownership without accountability creates organizational theater. You get the complexity of new structure without the benefits of improved performance.

*   **How to Crush It:**
    Set clear expectations and deadlines for process improvement. Give process owners authority to make necessary changes. Remove obstacles to their success. Hold them accountable for results, not activities.

    Create consequences for accountability avoidance. Promote successful process owners. Replace unsuccessful ones.

    **[IMPLEMENTATION SCRIPT]**
    "Process ownership means result ownership. If you want the title without the accountability, this isn't the role for you."

**Killer 10: Leadership Commitment Wavering**

*   **What Happens:**
    CEO and leadership team lose enthusiasm for organizational changes when implementation gets difficult. They second-guess decisions made during the sprint. They allow exceptions to new processes. They stop enforcing new accountability standards.

*   **Why It Kills You:**
    Leadership inconsistency kills any organizational change effort. If leaders don't commit to the new structure, nobody else will either. The organization reverts to previous dysfunction.

*   **How to Crush It:**
    CEO must commit publicly to organizational changes with specific timelines and success metrics. Make leadership commitment visible to entire organization. Create board reporting on structural improvement progress.

    Schedule monthly structure review meetings with external accountability. Document lessons learned and course corrections, but don't abandon core decisions.

    **[IMPLEMENTATION SCRIPT]**
    "We made these decisions because the old way wasn't working. Abandoning the new way at the first sign of difficulty guarantees we'll stay stuck with the old problems."

[03/03]
#### The Bottom Line on
Organizational Structure Success

These difficulties aren't hypothetical. They happen in every organizational structure initiative. The difference between companies that succeed and those that fail lies in preparation and response.

Expect these problems. Plan for these problems. Address these problems immediately when they arise.

Organizational structure isn't a one-time decision; it's an ongoing process. It's an ongoing discipline of clarity, accountability, and measurement.

Companies that master this discipline tend to dominate their markets. Companies that avoid this discipline are often dominated by competitors who adopt it.

**Your choice. Your results. Your responsibility.**

**Stop making excuses. Start making a structure. Execute relentlessly.**

### Main Tools: Organizational Redesign Toolkit

This toolkit supports leadership teams in redesigning their organization by placing the right people in the right roles — and developing them for the future.

#### 1. Current Team Assessment
This first sheet provides a summary of the initial BIT (Boss, Individual, Team) analysis of the executive team.
It captures how each current team member performs in their role based on cultural fit, capability, and team dynamics — laying the groundwork for people decisions.

#### 2. Define New Roles
Based on the revised organizational structure and earlier discussions about core and supporting activities, this sheet helps define the key roles your organization needs to succeed.

For each role, you specify:
*   Criticality
*   Key responsibilities
*   Must-have capabilities
This serves as your benchmark for evaluating internal fit or hiring needs.

#### 3. Decision Matrix
Here you match existing team members against all key roles (both current and newly defined).
You assess their fit using FIT scores, identify placement opportunities, and visualize where each person fits best — or doesn’t.

The matrix provides:
*   Role-by-role alignment
*   Cross-functional fit visibility
*   Quick identification of gaps

#### 4. Action Plan
Based on the Decision Matrix, team members are now categorized into:
*   Immediate placement
*   Development required
*   Transition out
This tool helps translate insight into action — identifying who goes where, what needs to be addressed, and how to proceed.

#### 5. Personal Development Plans (PDPs)
This sheet outlines next steps for each team member, depending on their placement and performance.
It includes:
*   Skill gaps
*   Priority capabilities to develop
*   Tailored learning paths
PDPs ensure continuous development for both A-players and B+ players with growth potential, driving long-term capacity building.

### Appendix Tool: Recruitment – Job Scorecard Template

This template supports hiring for new or vacant roles.

It aligns recruitment around:
*   Core capabilities needed to perform
*   Cultural and values fit
*   Key decisions and KPIs tied to the role
It’s ideal for ensuring that new hires fit seamlessly into the redesigned organizational structure and are ready to deliver impact from day one.

Deadline for completion Friday.

Expect the Fast Track feedback by Wednesday.

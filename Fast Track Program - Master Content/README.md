# Fast Track Program — Master Content

Source materials for the Fast Track program. These are the raw program assets: client deliverables, content guides, deep-dive PDFs, and tool templates delivered to client companies.

This folder is reference only — it is not served or deployed. It is the source of truth for what goes into each digital tool.

## Structure

Each module folder contains sprint subfolders. Inside each sprint:

```
sprint-XX-name/
├── client-deliverables/   PowerPoint decks customized per client company
├── content/               DOCX and PDF content guides
├── deep-dive/             PDF learning materials and research
└── tools/                 PPTX tool templates used in workshops
```
